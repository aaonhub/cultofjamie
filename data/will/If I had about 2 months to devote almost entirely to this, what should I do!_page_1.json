before i understood totally what was being said, i took a semester break off uni and didnt have a job so was essentially just fucking around for a few months of my life trying to figure what to do. this self enquiry stuff really drew me into it because id already tried therapy and spent countless hours researching self help and what not with none of it being effective. i kinda realised that if i didnt understand what was being communicated then id have to spend the rest of my life in a state of misery/conflict. \n\nso i had an immense amount of energy to try understand what was being said, all i really did was go for a walk every single day, and mulling over all the contemplations. so for a couple of months (similarly to what youve proposed) i just earnestly tried to understand what i was feeling and what beliefs/conflicts i had in place.","timestamp":"2024-07-06T00:24:43.460000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1258635899315556415","message_id":"1258636154128044114","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"tsnnoy"}]
