i remember the ‘sound of one hand clapping’ actually frying my brain and giving it a moment of complete peace pre sr

--- Message 2 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:23:47.072000+00:00 ---
the sound of one hand clapping is just complete and utter nothingness, and so it prompted me just to listen to what was going on in my experience

--- Message 3 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:24:46.618000+00:00 ---
another one i like is ‘how is my hand like the hand of an enlightened being?’

--- Message 4 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:27:32.345000+00:00 ---
one of the main parts of the koan is to just factory reset your brain via doubt. it forces you to stop and check your conditioned assumptions about the world

--- Message 5 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:32:22.800000+00:00 ---
if it was a koan, a zen master would have replied ‘a rubber duck’

--- Message 6 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:32:34.955000+00:00 ---
and then your third eye would have opened instantaneously

--- Message 7 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:34:40.154000+00:00 ---
well she’s holding up 4, she has mastered all the koans

--- Message 8 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:35:27.678000+00:00 ---
well all koans have all the context you need wrapped up in em

--- Message 9 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:35:38.460000+00:00 ---
i cant think of any that you need other knowledge for

--- Message 10 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:37:15.644000+00:00 ---
but you do have all the context all the time, esp for the one hand clapping. every moment of life contains the entirety of the thing

--- Message 11 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:39:07.999000+00:00 ---
yeah thats a component of it, but ‘figuring out the answer’ and just sitting on a conclusion is only ever a personal opinion. the koans are more so to continue the ongoing investigation of the mind in order to lure out SR

--- Message 12 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:39:37.489000+00:00 ---
but the answer you find isnt separate to the koan, it is born out of it

--- Message 13 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:40:09.824000+00:00 ---
haha yeah and thats sick, but isn’t the PURPOSE of a koan, thats just a part of it

--- Message 14 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:40:34.476000+00:00 ---
i say the ongoing enquiry of the mind as a result of it isnt something that can be concluded

--- Message 15 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:41:44.236000+00:00 ---
yeah, but everyone whos researched koans without even going into em can say ‘oh its just about nothingness or something man’

--- Message 16 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:42:17.454000+00:00 ---
and so i say its fun to conclude, but if someones looking for a transformative experience and not just amusing themselves then i dont see merit in conclusion

--- Message 17 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:42:53.392000+00:00 ---
what is the sound of one hand clapping and two capybaras yapping

--- Message 18 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:44:05.124000+00:00 ---
i just dont see how someone can fully ‘get’ a koan by concluding about it

--- Message 19 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:45:21.700000+00:00 ---
i feel like everyone can just go into a koan knowing the intention, but that just sidesteps the whole process

--- Message 20 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:45:34.134000+00:00 ---
i always thought the koan meta was kind of gimmicky

--- Message 21 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:46:45.221000+00:00 ---
lemme read the turtle one again and cook up some conclusions

--- Message 22 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:48:28.926000+00:00 ---
i get the sense that its the questioning that results in an added layer, the master wouldnt have put another object on top of nature had it not been for the question

--- Message 23 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:49:40.358000+00:00 ---
based as fuck, dont follow a teacher or a holy book

--- Message 24 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:52:13.889000+00:00 ---
man what i wrote is so goofy though ahahahaha, just a bit of fun

--- Message 25 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:53:37.841000+00:00 ---
the thing about koans though is that saying there is a right/wrong answer means that it breeds spiritual charlatans

--- Message 26 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:53:56.291000+00:00 ---
seeing as youve got your ticket and are seen as able to help

--- Message 27 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:56:24.517000+00:00 ---
hahaha theyre so silly but if someome has a totally transformative experience from em thats dope

--- Message 28 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-04T23:56:32.898000+00:00 ---
anyways im gonna head, nice to chat to you

--- Message 29 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T02:30:20.754000+00:00 ---
if you see intellect on intellect, then become aware of the distortion so as to not continue in the pattern of conflict

--- Message 30 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T02:30:43.717000+00:00 ---
awareness isnt cultivated, if you sense youre being distracted/split psychologically then be aware completely of the distortion

--- Message 31 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T02:31:27.562000+00:00 ---
there is no technique or practice of awareness, its the fact of life which leaves no room for accepting or denying

--- Message 32 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T02:32:17.862000+00:00 ---
a fact is so, theres no room for agreeing with it or arguing with it. if you can accept or deny it then its not truth, and so immediately become aware of this predicament

--- Message 33 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:21:10.479000+00:00 ---
even if one says there is no motive, but goes about practicing a technique for a psychological outcome then there must be motive

--- Message 34 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:21:41.062000+00:00 ---
a you and the practice that will operate on the problem

--- Message 35 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:23:33.532000+00:00 ---
non practice and practice are the same thing

--- Message 36 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:24:08.064000+00:00 ---
they both imply effort, which is resistance

--- Message 37 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:24:55.240000+00:00 ---
find out for yourself why this conflict has arisen

--- Message 38 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:27:20.279000+00:00 ---
yeah, the act of choosing requires effort

--- Message 39 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:28:44.456000+00:00 ---
just see for yourselves, dont follow me or kibble

--- Message 40 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:29:15.069000+00:00 ---
i can feel tension, but theres no fear if that answers your question

--- Message 41 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:31:21.397000+00:00 ---
thats nice to hear, just dont attach yourself to your remembrance of peace

--- Message 42 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:31:50.865000+00:00 ---
but apathy hasn’t addressed the root of all this fear no?

--- Message 43 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:33:35.751000+00:00 ---
all i can say is you have the capacity to understand the root of fear, it all lies within your experience. but it requires incredible attention

--- Message 44 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:34:04.540000+00:00 ---
check out any talk by j krishnamurti, try understand what hes saying and how it applies to your life

--- Message 45 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:35:27.086000+00:00 ---
was that insight because of a practice or something out of your hands?

--- Message 46 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:36:48.229000+00:00 ---
so the whole attempt to change our pattern of thinking is our traditional approach, but the very act of forcing thoughts away IS itself the pain as this depletes our energy

--- Message 47 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:38:02.129000+00:00 ---
how can a technique, which must be rigid and mechanical allow the mind to flourish?

--- Message 48 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:39:35.972000+00:00 ---
dont worry about me or anyone else, theres no merit or insight to be found in comparison

--- Message 49 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:40:49.578000+00:00 ---
how can there be a technique of no control? is letting go of control something to be cultivated

--- Message 50 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:41:43.623000+00:00 ---
moreover, to have a prompt to sit down means theres an attempt. meditation happens when there isnt any expectation

--- Message 51 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:42:33.546000+00:00 ---
i understand the intention is to just sit and observe, but then there is no meditation happening as theres a motive to be meditative

--- Message 52 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:43:36.277000+00:00 ---
yes and if one has a mind with motives then there cant any viewing of the tree without the observer

--- Message 53 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:44:10.209000+00:00 ---
yes but why would one practice a do nothing meditation, why label it at all and have it in your back pocket ready to perform at any given notice

--- Message 54 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:44:24.302000+00:00 ---
i know, i appreciate you having this conversation with me

--- Message 55 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:44:38.908000+00:00 ---
im approaching this with no intention of being combative or abrasive

--- Message 56 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:47:20.829000+00:00 ---
so this issue arises because of the introduction of the practice in the first place

--- Message 57 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T08:47:30.407000+00:00 ---
sorry to cut things short ive got dinner now

--- Message 58 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T09:25:46.539000+00:00 ---
yeah i imagine mania and depression would end

--- Message 59 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T09:26:26.127000+00:00 ---
so all this is to say there wouldnt be a machine to observe if one didnt accept any practice as useful for enquiring

--- Message 60 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T12:37:25.660000+00:00 ---
if you fall asleep thats fine, if you get distracted thats fine too. its not about ending up somewhere but more so allowing the movement of compassion/intelligence to flow

--- Message 61 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:35:37.800000+00:00 ---
i think we are mixing up transmission and method, and confusing them for interchangeable terms. i agree that its valuable to speak about this, explore it together and sanely understand whats going on. but there cannot be understanding when there is method, only when the mind is completely rid of its own conditioning/systems/practices can there be a transformative insight.

--- Message 62 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:37:06.612000+00:00 ---
i don't see JK as having a method, he doesn't ask you to think/act/believe in any direction. he speaks and we watch ourselves as he speaks, however he doesn't make you interpret what he says through any lens

--- Message 63 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:44:04.793000+00:00 ---
i enjoy sitting and doing nothing quite a lot of the time, however this isn't something thats forced. whereas doing that and slapping a label on it as a 'practice' means that you attach to certain postures or behaviours and then it becomes mechanical

--- Message 64 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:47:36.949000+00:00 ---
the word 'do' implies effort, this effort is a mechanical response to our perception of a problem. however the practice to sidestep the problem is itself mechanical and born out of the problem

--- Message 65 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:48:22.835000+00:00 ---
a mind that is completely still doesn't need any practice, as the practice is born from misery

--- Message 66 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-07T13:49:25.556000+00:00 ---
if you're distracted but desire to oay attention to something different, then theres immediately a conflict. its up to you to be completely aware of this distortion

--- Message 67 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:00:38.770000+00:00 ---
find out for yourself, is there anyone doing self enquiry?

--- Message 68 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:01:48.251000+00:00 ---
you arent missing anything, its all there in experience

--- Message 69 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:10:54.005000+00:00 ---
because what you think is you is a distortion that makes you waste your energy trying to appease it

--- Message 70 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:11:10.901000+00:00 ---
what you actually are requires no effort or forcing to exist

--- Message 71 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:11:36.965000+00:00 ---
the worse experience youre afraid of in the future is what is right now

--- Message 72 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:11:53.429000+00:00 ---
so if you can be aware of what is now then you can end it

--- Message 73 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:12:13.811000+00:00 ---
even if it sucks or is unpleasant, go on anyway

--- Message 74 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:14:50.970000+00:00 ---
any effort in self enquiry is an illusion that needs investigation

--- Message 75 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:15:12.803000+00:00 ---
not trying to be a hardass, i needed to hear this when i was in that position

--- Message 76 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:18:25.859000+00:00 ---
yeah totally, good to clarify and i didnt think you were

--- Message 77 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:20:12.533000+00:00 ---
when it feels like we are ‘doing’ it theres an effort there. whereas the actual understanding of what you are is effortless. therefore im saying observe the feeling of ‘me doing’, as it is ultimately the structure that needs examining

--- Message 78 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:20:51.494000+00:00 ---
see youve already tried to escape it just then

--- Message 79 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:21:09.979000+00:00 ---
how will it end if you dont understand it in its entirety and be completely finished with it

--- Message 80 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:26:44.257000+00:00 ---
‘How do I operate without the belief the expectation will become true’ this is an escape, since the fact is you do believe the expectation will come true

--- Message 81 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T01:26:55.099000+00:00 ---
and to split yourself from that is a divide

--- Message 82 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:54:31.888000+00:00 ---
the expectation that ‘what im thinking about can directly affect me’ is what is in your present experience.

--- Message 83 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:55:07.308000+00:00 ---
and so fear arises, because the feeling of you and the feeling of fear are identical

--- Message 84 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:55:42.507000+00:00 ---
the divide comes when you see this fear, and instead of seeing it through you then ask ‘how do i get rid of it’

--- Message 85 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:56:05.986000+00:00 ---
im saying dont offload this very vital task to ANYONE else, only you can see through this misery and end it

--- Message 86 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:57:06.227000+00:00 ---
you have an immense intelligence, im not referring to the collection of knowledge we typically ascribe as academia. i mean the capacity to solve our problems for ourselves and not rely on another psychologically

--- Message 87 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T02:57:39.276000+00:00 ---
the continuation of self enquiry or the plan to do self enquiry in the future is escaping and prolonging this needless misery

--- Message 88 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:21:29.540000+00:00 ---
yes thats exactly why its so important to be aware of it, because the reflexive pain is the entire extent of it and if you can see that through then youre out

--- Message 89 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:24:01.628000+00:00 ---
you’ve answered all your own questions, the question and the answer are packaged together.

--- Message 90 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:24:34.179000+00:00 ---
if you think it’s absolutely necessary then go for it, i just question this

--- Message 91 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:24:52.127000+00:00 ---
nothing is above scrutiny or enquiring into

--- Message 92 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:33:23.045000+00:00 ---
the fact is the physical pain, but the desire induces psychological pain on top of that. so even though pain is an unpleasant sensation there can be compassion for oneself in the place of envy or self pity

--- Message 93 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:34:30.732000+00:00 ---
the thought of yourself not in pain doesnt dull the fact of present experience, it just creates psychological hurt ontop of the fact

--- Message 94 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-08T03:55:24.896000+00:00 ---
im using the words you used here @import_pickle

--- Message 95 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-14T01:19:25.398000+00:00 ---
does the feeling of me exist outside of this movement?

--- Message 96 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-22T12:08:18.659000+00:00 ---
i reckon the confusion arises because of the notion that there are two things, the experience of perception right now and the me experiencing it. if you call your actions/tendencies your ‘personality’, theres only ever the perception of that, however the misinterpretation is that there is something other than the immediate action

--- Message 97 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-22T12:09:17.074000+00:00 ---
you can see the full extent of your personality right now

--- Message 98 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-22T12:10:36.769000+00:00 ---
like if you shake someones hand, the common misinterpretation of the physical experience of gripping flesh is that there is ‘the feel of my own hand’ and ‘the feeling of their hand’ when in reality it is only just the physical experience

--- Message 99 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-22T12:11:42.216000+00:00 ---
in the same way, this feeling of ‘me being distinct’ and ‘their personality’ is just a misunderstanding of fact

--- Message 100 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-24T07:43:14.597000+00:00 ---
just to respond to your question in the q’s for jamie tab, is attachment love?

--- Message 101 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-24T07:43:48.959000+00:00 ---
is the pleasure of physical contact and the excitement in your body love? or is love something different to pleasurable stimuli

--- Message 102 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-24T08:25:25.698000+00:00 ---
are these feelings genuine choiceless love

--- Message 103 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-24T08:26:07.795000+00:00 ---
or does the attachment also mean you have worry about losing them, and a desire to repeat the novel experience

--- Message 104 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-04-28T08:08:16.269000+00:00 ---
i reckon all these problems arise because we refuse to be alone

--- Message 173 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-05-01T00:44:22.229000+00:00 ---
the capacity is there because you are always aware of the fact of your experience. clarity of your experience is possible because your experience is fact. thats what i mean when i say the capacity to be aware is there.

the reason asking how doesnt work is because you genuinely know the answer, but no one else can work this thing out for you. how also means adopting a mechanical method which requires psychological time. 

on psychological time: we constantly assume that problems in our inner world can be solved given enough time. while physically we need time to coordinate meeting up with someone or creating machines, we haven’t questioned if psychological time is actually doing what we think it does at all. inwardly, insight is not a gradual process, when one is completely aware of something, there is no centre from which attention happens.   and so the understanding or full attention of our problems means clarity of them, and therefore the ending of it. this isn’t gradual nor does it need direction in thought towards security 

if you’re unsatisfied with your life, no amount of working will ever bring peace. the root hasn’t been addressed and there is still contradiction in what you want and what your life is

--- Message 174 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-05-01T00:45:51.419000+00:00 ---
its correct that doing a task requires physical time, however it is not correct that understanding our inner world takes time.

i’d pose to you, is it possible for the mind to register its challenges and yet not register psychological hurt?

--- Message 176 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-05-01T00:50:46.032000+00:00 ---
to further expand on this, gradual incremental ‘understanding’ (and i use that term VERY generously cuz its not really understanding) of our inner world requires time. and for there to be psychological time there has to be a ‘me’ who is experiencing time right? and so this ‘me’ is operating on a problem continuously but has not yet had the insight that it is itself the problem. and that resolving the problem doesnt provide insight into the ‘me’. and so all its hurts, prides, fears and jealousy still operates unconsciously

--- Message 177 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-05-01T00:51:42.716000+00:00 ---

im not trying to highlight any one thing, we can both agree that you are experiencing sensory perception. the magic is that the fact isn’t touched by the word, you have to look at the feelings and all the implications behind the word. 

the answer isnt a verbal conclusion, i don’t need to know a thing about your personal history to know that you are human being experiencing the fact of sensory perception

thats fine not to know, to not know means to stop relying on external perspectives and completely see that knowledge cannot provide a satisfactory answer to your inquiries

if one is to delve into what forgiveness is though in the typical sense, it does require someone to hold onto their past experience in order to forgive. and memory is limited. 

in reference to what you said, is that actually forgiveness at all? is resolving ones anger forgiving another?

because as i said, forgiveness requires memory. but once you rid yourself of the psychological hurt, ie the memory, then all that stands is an intelligent understanding of the situation

well i still had a lot of tension in my body from spending years in stress, but gradually its all just dissolved on its own. idk about blind rage, i used to be pretty sad all the time and now i feel neutral or affectionate every now and then. not really sad or angry at all. i really think you should spend some time privately to really understand your experience, not in a public setting. too much influence, especially in a server like this. theres a great deal of stimulation in checking the chat but stimulation isnt going to deepen your understanding

when you say ‘connection made to yourself’ im assuming you’re referring to an emotional investment in the image one has of themselves. 
as for why you say it’s ‘useless’ i’m not saying its good or bad or useless or useful but it is clearly quite harmful and causes tremendous pain in everyday life, that’s a fact to me in the same way i’d feel a pin pricking into my leg.

it is perfectly logical to experience anxiety if there is the perception that one is being threatened, in this case there is a perception (even if fundamentally it is a distortion) that my life will be worse off so hence theres anxiety

--- Message 646 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-10-10T00:41:49.943000+00:00 ---
yeah theres two emotional responses because youre reacting to reality as-well as the psychological structure of the self

more importantly, is the observer the one who is affected by the premise actually a distinct entity to it?

theres this tremendous emptiness that is looming as a result of this threat and thought is trying to cover it up

can one be so attentive that thought doesnt jump in to cover this emptiness?

and in that attention, one sees how thought is creating an observer apart from the emptiness

--- Message 655 | File: general_page_3.json | Timestamp: 2024-10-10T00:48:42.498000+00:00 ---
and in this awareness the psychological structure dissolves itself?

because the mind is constantly emptying itself, and that fact is utterly terrifying

what i determine helpfulness as is completely arbitary and on a moment to moment basis. i understand that 'there isn't a self deep down' but there is clearly a great deal of suffering in the world. i see the mechanical repeating as the totality of this suffering, and so 'helpful' in this context would be to point that out

it is important to investigate what you see as addiction and what is benign. because people are quick to assume smokers are addicts, but not people that watch too many lifestyle gurus online or people
who go to church

addiction typically is just the feeble attempt at breaking the pattern of ones life, and one needs to investigate why they have an addiction in the first place, not judging it for being there

in a sense that is what people are trained to do when confronted with something that disturbs them. but it clearly doesnt work as most people are neurotic. your response to the problem has no meaning if there is not an understanding of what the problem actually is.

the distinction between the inner and outer world is just a function of how english works. we need a subject (i) and an object (house). but in matters of psychological health, there is no distinction between the two and thought can only bring about a fracturing of our conscious experience. i.e. the belief that there are people that you will never get along with

to tackle it another way, we are trained to examine the problem faced by ‘me’ instead observing what the ‘me’ actually is. no amount of thinking can end all problems, thinking is a closed circuit. it’s important to understand how this is the case

well i want to point out that the me and the ‘problem im dealing with’ arent two distinct things. its more so that previously i used to assume ‘okay my knowledge about myself is true and doesnt require any examination’ but after it was pointed out by a few people that you can’t actually separate a sense of self from the problem i became intrigued and naturally wanted to investigate my self-image

any problem we have is related to expectations we have about ourselves and our own circumstance. the content of the sense of self is entirely constructed by our own ambitions, regrets, hurts and prides.

so for example, if i suffer because i dont have as much money as i thought i would by a certain age, my expected outcome/ambition IS what ‘myself’ is made up of. i am not a distinct entity looking at this challenge of suffering, the sense of ‘me’ is intrinsic to the challenge. there is no challenge if my mind is clean of comparison

so our traditional approach to challenges is typically imagining ourselves as distinct from the challenge and then trying to fix the problem with the assumption that we are not related to problem.

the constant search for an end or a thing to accumulate is the very source of frustration

--- Message 2122 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:25:19.626000+00:00 ---
learning without accumulation has no end point or starting point, it is happening as it is

--- Message 2123 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:28:26.596000+00:00 ---
yeah, there is absolutely nothing you can horde that can answer every single challenge you have

--- Message 2124 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:28:54.878000+00:00 ---
life requires a fresh mind every single step of the way. this doesnt have to be a exhausting vigilance

--- Message 2125 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:29:37.301000+00:00 ---
you dont need to whip yourself into place

--- Message 2126 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:29:57.589000+00:00 ---
absolutely, it seems to be a fight if you frame it that way

--- Message 2127 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:30:47.916000+00:00 ---
so im not saying give up your fighting, but be aware why you fight

--- Message 2128 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:31:20.369000+00:00 ---
because we spend more time resisting fighting than actually fighting

--- Message 2129 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:31:35.433000+00:00 ---
its best to just get as close to it as possible

--- Message 2130 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:38:34.990000+00:00 ---
its hard because we complicate it, we take something simple and beautiful and we measure it

--- Message 2131 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:39:18.658000+00:00 ---
and so after having experienced something nice, we immediately try think of some way to experience the same pleasure

--- Message 2132 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:39:28.992000+00:00 ---
and so our current circumstance is seen as insufficient

--- Message 2133 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:39:50.716000+00:00 ---
and we never understand what time means. what measuring means

--- Message 2134 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:40:09.366000+00:00 ---
we always try experience things to continue on, never for their own sake

--- Message 2135 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:41:34.422000+00:00 ---
and so we never allow ourselves to breathe properly

--- Message 2136 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-04T18:43:19.169000+00:00 ---
yeah, you cant be told truth in a book or in a saying

--- Message 2137 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-05T09:56:29.056000+00:00 ---
its what we are already doing, but thought comes in and has all these post-hoc justifications why why we acted the way we did

--- Message 2138 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-05T09:58:02.194000+00:00 ---
if we are tired, we sleep. we dont need to say ‘well if im well rested i can get more people to like me’. you sleep because its a natural course of action. it is an end unto itself

--- Message 2139 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-05T10:00:46.423000+00:00 ---
then thought comes in and creates a narrative around why the action was performed

--- Message 2140 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-08-05T10:21:33.164000+00:00 ---
i just cant grasp it with thought but i feel present

--- Message 2141 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:01:49.359000+00:00 ---
doubt and skepticism dont have to be tinged with fear. i was skeptical because sure i had an experience, but i don’t see why any experience should be significant and conclusive. i’m very cautious to offer conclusions naturally because they block one from continuing to investigate.

--- Message 2142 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:02:45.291000+00:00 ---
i can reasonably and comfortably say that i dont feel anxious, but i dont want to say that this limited experience is the only factor that is important. i am skeptical of any conclusions, which isnt dismissing or against them

--- Message 2143 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:05:01.200000+00:00 ---
well youve gotta understand that its quite a bold claim to make that you’ve had an insight like that. i doubted it because it is deserving of scrutiny, not because i didnt think it was the case

--- Message 2144 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:05:53.469000+00:00 ---
if i see that yes my experience aligned with jamie, that may be an important factor. but it still deserves scrutiny and doubt

--- Message 2145 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:06:11.604000+00:00 ---
i see that i dont feel anxious, but why shouldnt i question further?

--- Message 2146 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:18:44.452000+00:00 ---
well sure, if i see i feel neurotic or relaxed why should i have a conclusion about it?

--- Message 2147 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2025-10-06T01:18:56.360000+00:00 ---
not saying im this or that but i hope you understand

--- Message 2148 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:13:10.450000+00:00 ---
that’s a great question, so we are attempting to understand the observer in order to get rid of it. but we need to understand that our approach toward understanding is also part of the observer

--- Message 2149 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:13:49.793000+00:00 ---
so if i attempt to understand myself through a particular lens, that lens is part of myself

--- Message 2150 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:14:13.048000+00:00 ---
and so there is striving for continuity and therefore no clarity

--- Message 2151 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:14:37.046000+00:00 ---
the conditioned approach is the attempt to continue through to tomorrrow

--- Message 2152 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:15:00.525000+00:00 ---
so to observe plainly does not require any background

--- Message 2153 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:15:40.101000+00:00 ---
the entity itself is fallacious because it is just the gathering of the past, and not what is currently taking place

--- Message 2154 | File: general_page_1.json | Timestamp: 2026-01-12T01:16:26.552000+00:00 ---
any progress the entity makes is merely the accumulation of more knowledge
