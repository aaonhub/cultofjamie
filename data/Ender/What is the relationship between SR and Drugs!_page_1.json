They can be just as destructive as hard drugs like meth. There are people who have taken LSD recreationally and then ended up with a lifetime of PTSD from their trip.

And if you don't want to listen to me and only to Jamie that's fine. Just ignore what I say. \n\nI have never taken any LSD or other psychedelic drug.
