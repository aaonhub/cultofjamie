In neuroscience, if a visual input is deemed to be particularly threatening by some part of the visual processing system, it just completely bypasses everything and goes straight to the amygdala to trigger a fear response. This is why you get scared of something before you ever realize what you're scared of. I suspect that it's such a deeply primordial physiological program in the brain that there is no logical understanding that could stop it from operating.","timestamp":"2025-08-23T23:51:51.357000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
