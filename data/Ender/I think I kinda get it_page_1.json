I do that as someone who has experienced the realization/phenomenon (or I guess all you know is that I claim to). Just pretend I'm capy or something. And if you don't want to listen to me and only to Jamie that's fine. Just ignore what I say. \n\nI can't know for sure, but based on the description it does kind of sound similar in terms of the experience of not being worried, but there is a key difference. The similarity is that you were not worrying about a self-image because your mind was so focused on the present moment. The key difference is that Jamie isn't just talking about an on-going state of mental peace like what you experienced. Jamie is describing a phenomenon where you realize that it isn't possible to think yourself *which then causes* the permanent state of mental peace.","timestamp":"2025-08-24T19:02:15.320000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"194614370662088704","username":"ntnn9","avatar":"bc8eef1016fc2e5fb1edeecc27c1c980","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"NTNN9","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"709752884257882135","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CAT","badge":"ad1b52f6e0cafddcdaa1a787e53d9a74"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"709752884257882135","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CAT","badge":"ad1b52f6e0cafddcdaa1a787e53d9a74"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1405903817622556732","message_id":"1405903817622556732","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":14,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
