I do that as someone who has experienced the realization/phenomenon (or I guess all you know is that I claim to). Just pretend I'm capy or something. And if you don't want to listen to me and only to Jamie that's fine. Just ignore what I say. \n\nThe core central concept that is the primary misunderstanding is believing that it makes any sense at all to identify with a thought, in the same way that it makes no sense to see a picture or hear sound and believe that this sensory perception is literally you. There is no division between you and the rest of the world that makes sense, it is entirely invented. It is not that \"I exist in the world\". There is just \"the world\". This can be logically reasoned through without too much trouble , but truly viscerally grasping it is quite tricky. As I understand it, the main thing that really makes the fact that you can't think about yourself intuitively obvious is understanding your perception of time. I'll attach a diagram I made and hopefully it'll be helpful. \n\nAbout the peripheral subjective beliefs: It is not necessary to go through every single belief you have about yourself and correct them individually. After the core realization that you can't think about yourself, all of the beliefs you hold about yourself--or in other words your self-image--just automatically cease and you no longer identify with it. Self-knowledge just becomes knowledge.","timestamp":"2025-08-24T18:52:14.941000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1406645851883049090","message_id":"1406645851883049090","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
