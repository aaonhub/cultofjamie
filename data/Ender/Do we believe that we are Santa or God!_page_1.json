There are many other computers with the same hardware specifications so the hardware specifications cannot be what that computer really is. Ultimately no matter what description the computer displays, there could always be another computer that fits the description. This situation is analogous to Jamie's \"so am I so that can't be you.\"\n\nHowever you are fundamentally different from a computer. \"Computer\" is an abstraction we have invented to describe an idea we have. There is no such thing as \"computer\" in reality. \n\nThe \"thing\" which you actually are is current direct sensory perception. Thinking is merely part of that direct sensory perception. Thinking cannot be \"about\" the experience because it is itself part of the experience. Suppose you had a TV with 6 sections, each representing one of your senses (sight, sound, taste, touch, smell, thoughts). No matter how clever or sophisticated the thought section gets, it will never make more sense to say \"this thought section describes the entire image\" than \"this thought section is just part of the whole image.\" \n\nThat is one explanation for why you can't think about yourself. Another is Jamie's alien analogy. There is a long conversation about it here if you are interested: <#1440440742236393472>","timestamp":"2025-12-14T08:40:27.167000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1448457849528385728","message_id":"1449637731952234558","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":20,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
