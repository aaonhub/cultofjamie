It's a tension that's more like a heightened focus. My hands started to get a little sweaty. However it's not an unpleasant feeling at all. There's no dread about the outcome of going on stage,or worry if others will judge, just focus on doing well *right now*. While on stage there was an absolute focus only on the actions right now as opposed to worrying about future consequences. The thoughts about consequences just didn't arise at all. Thoughts didn't arise much in general. I suppose Jamie would not define that experience as an emotion. \n\nAnxiety is when your stomach feels like it has a hole and your hands start shaking which arise from thoughts about future consequences. It is completely different from the heightened tension which forces your focus away from thinking and into acting *right now*. I think that state fright is a combination of having anxiety and the heightened tension but the anxiety overshadows the tension. \n\nI think in general whether something counts as an emotion depends on whether it serves to bring focus on performing effectively right now (which makes it NOT an emotion) or whether it forces the mind into thought spirals (which makes it an emotion) \n\nIn the end I can only guess Jamie's definition and we'll have to ask him directly to find out","timestamp":"2026-01-25T23:07:17.821000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1450029121051562044","message_id":"1464874510292353036","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1450172233480671293","channel_id":"1450029121051562044","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"tldr; jamie's definition of emotion is such that it is by definition true that there is no relationship between thought and emotions","timestamp":"2025-12-15T17:06:43.359000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
