A permanently active self-defense mechanism is not healthy because it overrides the natural state of peace and love (or something spiritual sounding like that). Robert Sapolsky wrote a whole book about it titled \"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers\", but it's more abut hormones and damage to the body than about psychological liberation.","timestamp":"2025-12-14T05:29:46.362000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1445487300187263107","message_id":"1449633462037385280","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":13,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1449611568584331445","channel_id":"1445487300187263107","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I definitely don't feel related to past actions.
