However, there is danger to the notion of \"you are the sensory perception\" because the moment you say it, it becomes a thought that can be identified with. This is what JK means when he says \"the word is not the thing\". It has to be internalized without the words. A more precise way of answering the question of \"who am I\" is to not say anything at all, because the literal sensory perception that is YOU is already present and already sufficiently answers the question. This is what Jamie means by \"the question is unanswerable in the form it presents itself,\" since it appears to be implied that you're meant to answer with words, even though words are inherently incapable of answering the question.","timestamp":"2025-09-26T22:57:47.567000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"257171232745717770","username":"aetham","avatar":"680742add545ca1aa96a40b5a3649636","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Aetham","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1419796763409387710","message_id":"1421265453451317249","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":87,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1421264218514133135","channel_id":"1419796763409387710","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The cliche but true answer is \"you're already at the magical place\" but I can see how that isn't really a helpful thing to say \nAs an aside, I found it helpful to take occasional breaks for self inquiry just to live life.
