Are you saying that without thought there is nothing? The possibility of a no mind state during meditation seems to directly contradict this idea. \n\nIn response to your last paragraph: I would argue that you have no answers at all if you haven't even touched the issue, but I think that's just because we have different definitions of \"answer\".","timestamp":"2025-10-12T22:47:22.373000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1426895439864528967","message_id":"1426921716357005424","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1427062656396955790","channel_id":"1426895439864528967","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"My understanding of the non-dualist position is that the idea of a continuous \"me\" who exists across time fundamentally separate from the rest of the world, is an incoherent concept. You can't think about yourself because this entity doesn't really exist, and was made up entirely. It's kind of like Theseus's Ship: the idea of a continuous ship was made up entirely so we start confusing ourselves when we look for where the \"ship\" stops being itself. \n\nIt's not that thoughts are an observation imperfect approximation and we would only accept an absolutely perfect simulation to qualify as \"thinking about yourself\". The true \"yourself\" is a *somethingness* that is completely indescribable, which is itself consciousness. \n\nThe book analogy misses one key component of the human condition, which is that all sensory experiences happen \"now\". You can't actually go back to previous pages. You can only write new pages with what you believe the past was. In no case is a new page actually an old page, which is analogous to all sensory experiences happening \"now\".","timestamp":"2025-10-12T22:37:30.827000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1426895439864528967","message_id":"1426905971598426122","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1427050023169949736","channel_id":"1426895439864528967","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think this discussion goes deeper than SR and into metaphysics and ontology. For context: I'm a panpsychist. \n\nIt is trivial that it's not possible to think about literally nothing because any representation of nothing is itself something. When you think about an \"apple\" you think about an abstraction about a physical thing. This is reasonable because the properties of the imagined apple more or less seem to resemble an actual physical apple. It is possible to think about four since four is itself a thought. \n\nThinking about the self-image belongs in an entirely different category from the three mentioned previously. A common misconception is believing that you can't think about yourself because the thought is just a thought, but still abstractly represents yourself. The actual reason is because the concept of \"me\" is itself an answer to the intellectually incoherent question of, \"who am I,\" in the same way that , \"B\" is an intellectually incoherent answer to the question, \"what is the biggest color of the alphabet.\" It makes no sense to tell a continuous story about a \"me\"  who exists throughout time because there is no actual experienced continuity of \"me\". The intellectual incoherency is seen through understanding the relationship between thought and time. \n\nThe adjectives associated with the self-image do have utility, but ultimately none of them actually have any relation to your true nature at all, which is consciousness itself.","timestamp":"2025-10-12T21:47:18.831000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"185405093263310848","username":"loungemeister","avatar":"432d7e176d622918c35e309f469dfffc","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Loungemeister","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1317652487552893031","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"SKG","badge":"7ed1a7788cf94367411222f8c02c523e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1317652487552893031","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"SKG","badge":"7ed1a7788cf94367411222f8c02c523e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1426895439864528967","message_id":"1426895439864528967","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
