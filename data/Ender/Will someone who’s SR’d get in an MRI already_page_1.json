This is an extremely controversial idea put forward by Rupert Sheldrake which he calls morphic resonance. He claims that the brain is a tuning system that can tune into this morphic field of collective conscious habitual memory. It sounds ridiculous but there's some vaguely compelling evidence that somewhat supports it:\nNear death experiences where someone knows something that they shouldn't be able to know at all, like a red shoe out of sight being on the rooftop of the hospital. \nThe feeling of knowing that someone is watching, which allegedly is an actual verified phenomenon by some sort of statistical analysis (really I dunno I'm the most skeptical of this one). \nMemories of past lives in a child that they can't possibly have known about, which are then later confirmed to be a real person. \nDuring psychedelic trips when people have extremely intense experiences, there is actually less brain activity rather than more. Some say that it's as if during that experience their mind was more open. This would mean that usually the mind is closed off which possibly indicates that the brain is a system that tunes out certain consciousness for a survival advantage. This could only be the case if consciousness itself was not created by the brain, but rather channeled by it, and psychedelic experiences are actually a deeper layer of the field consciousness that is uncovered. Admittedly the whole idea is a bit out there so idk.

We have no idea which parts of the brain are really doing what, only vague ideas about blobs being related to certain functions. \n\nI had a theory that episodic memories (which is what we in this server refer to as \"self-image\") themselves are what cause suffering. Ending them ends the suffering. Every event gets recorded twice. Once as semantic memory and once as purely emotional episodic memory. That doubling is the recursion Jamie is talking about. SR causes the brain to delete the episodic memory program because it is seen as unnecessary, causing a vague sensation in the brain often experienced as a feeling of a massless solid object in the head (which every SR person I've talked to has experienced). Once episodic memories are deleted, any emotional sensations triggered by thinking no longer occur. We could look to see whether the area that supposedly processes episodic memories is less active, or possibly absent. There isn't really a discrete chunk of the brain allocated to certain functions though.
