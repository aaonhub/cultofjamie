I think the *meaning* of the statement can only really be understood through direct insight into one's experience, as opposed to intellectual understanding of concepts. I can't know for sure, but I suspect meditation is amazingly helpful for *feeling* the meaning of the words as what you directly experience. I strongly encourage you to try meditation. I've found it to be very helpful with connecting words to direct experience. \n\nIf conventional formal mediation doesn't work for you, I bet it's possible to find an alternative that does work.","timestamp":"2025-10-19T17:07:11.749000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1429395848999207054","message_id":"1429403558905774101","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1429512039151439892","channel_id":"1429395848999207054","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Who is talking in that recording?","timestamp":"2025-10-19T16:50:29.183000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1429395848999207054","message_id":"1429413659393916989","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
