Is that not knowledge about yourself? \n\nDisappointment is a strange and tricky thing. We are disappointed because we make comparisons. However, the choice of what comparison we decide to make somehow manages to be, more often than not, comparing what you believe your present circumstance to be with an imaginary way things could have gone better. In that moment the disappointment comes from the comparison and not from the literal direct experience of what happened. But why did we decide to specifically make that comparison? It isn't any more or less valid than making a comparison with literally any other imaginary scenario that did not happen. \n\nObserve what comparisons you make and why you make them. Then try a different comparison and see what happens. I doubt it'll directly solve anything but it may give you better insight into the direct nature of your own psychological suffering.","timestamp":"2025-11-18T03:09:18.498000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1440162302203789463","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":120,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1440157866861269052","channel_id":"1428677755909701702","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Are you disappointed?

I'm not sure but there's probably some sort of developmental psychology something or other such that they require interaction with people to \"develop normally\". I think you're right that for babies, interaction is a need as much as food is if they die without interaction. However, I would guess that the thing that makes a baby die without interaction isn't psychological loneliness from their self-image, it's some sort of physiological lack of endocrine simulation problem.","timestamp":"2025-11-09T17:30:36.835000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1437007369866313841","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":18,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1436469556884537476","channel_id":"1428677755909701702","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> After understanding all this what will be changed?\n> Not to desire? how does that even work?\nTo desires is to want \"me\" to acquire something. Desire ceases when it is seen that there is no \"me\" that is able to acquire. \n\n> Is there a different way to go around it while not having to fulfill the desire?\nAs far as I know there is no way to \"go around\" a desire. I know there's a technique in psychiatry for addiction patients called \"urge surfing\" where you focus so hard on the feeling of desire that it mysteriously becomes less powerful. \n\n> Is it to change the perspective so not to think there is even a “different” state from the present that can be achieved?\nYes. All that exists is the present. \n\n> If there is a problem then it should be solved isn’t it? \nActions can still be taken to fulfill goals, but they are without any emotional significance. Nothing is really seen as a \"problem\", there are just circumstances. \"Problem\" is a label you add yourself. \n\n> Is it even possible to just go like this “I’m feeling bad, let me stop thinking there is a better “me” in a different situation that doesn’t feel bad. So I don’t feel the need to change my state to another imaginary one so the feeling goes way.”\nSR is not a technique where one learns how to not think about a better \"me\". It's a realization that the concept of \"me\" is incoherent in the first place.","timestamp":"2025-11-07T21:37:10.675000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"745395430791315477","username":"juba.hu","avatar":"596e62ed926774f517d0162a9a894ab3","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"𝙟𝙪𝙗𝙖","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1436426009288380598","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1436461358999929027","channel_id":"1428677755909701702","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Loneliness is not a real need.
