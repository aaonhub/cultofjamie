Believing that you will be successful only helps in so far as it affects your actions. It might have an effect on health since the mind and body are connected, but I would think it has nothing to do with manifesting energies? \n\nOneness is pretty much just a fact not much more to say\n\naloneness: in terms of human minds interacting with each other aloneness seems to just be true. The actual condition of aloneness isn't scary, but rather the idea of seeing yourself as a completely isolated entity thats sort of claustrophobic in your own skull is quite scary. I suppose talking about it can be spooky because theres an inevitable moment in the conversation when you realize its all just thoughts in your own head. At that point it may be beneficial to go find a distraction so one does not end up in a thought spiral. \n\nlaw of correspondence - SR doesn't seem to have affected my worldly fortunes at all. It does seem true that a cluttered mind will end up with a cluttered desk, but that's only because a cluttered mind is too cluttered to remember to clean the desk once in a while. There are other various self-fulfilling prophecies but they are all explained by psychological thought patterns causing psychological behavior patterns causing patterns in a persons life (romantic relationships tend to have a lot of these). \n\nrhythm: i havent had any novel experiences about rhythm or cosmic cycles or anything like that. i read about something similar to that in sadhguru's inner engineering, and i have no idea what hes talking about. i would guess sadhguru might say that it has something to do with the heavily analytical nature of the jnana yoga path to enlightenment (\"jnana yoga\" is what we call \"self-inquiry\"), so we never really needed to intuitively feel the cycles of the universe","timestamp":"2026-02-01T06:14:20.002000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
