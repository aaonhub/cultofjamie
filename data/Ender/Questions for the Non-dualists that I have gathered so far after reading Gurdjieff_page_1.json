One such question is, \"what is nothing?\" Anything you respond with cannot be nothing, so it's unanswerable with words. That question of, \"who am I,\" is the same way, since anything that you respond with communicates a thought, which is not what you are. You do not answer the question of, \"who am I,\" by responding with more and more sophisticated words. You answer it by realizing that thoughts are not able to answer the question at all. As I understand it, the most useful thinking you can do is inquiring into the nature of thought, time, and how they relate to each other, since that explains why thoughts can't answer the question. \n\nSecond question: \nI can't speak for others. Your understanding of the word \"about\" matches mine. \"You can't think about yourself\" means that thoughts by their very nature are not able to describe what you really are. It's just like how you can't think about nothing, since and thought *is itself* something. The reason why you can't think about yourself goes back to thought and time and their relationship. \n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of a continuous \"me\" is itself the error. It's sort of like how the Theseus' ship isn't actually one ship with a continuous existence that has duration. We invent the idea of a continuous ship through thought, even though there is actually a new ship every moment which is unrelated to the ships that came before. \nEvery moment there is a new \"me\".

You have experience of it (or ig in a sense you *are* the experience of it), but no direct connection to how that word relates to your direct sensory experience.","timestamp":"2025-10-03T04:54:07.149000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1421787656307609700","message_id":"1423056646220808234","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":30,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1422951840877903904","channel_id":"1421787656307609700","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Well now we're just getting into definitions. The purpose of mediation and self-inquiry are the same, but they are different activities. Jamie says it's possible for SR to happen without formal mediation. I think he's right, but I also think he is very careful there to say \"formal\" mediation, because in some sense you're always meditating because you're always absolutely aware of the entirety of your direct sensory experience. Formal mediation just cuts down on the amount of stimulus present, so it becomes easier to realize that it is impossible to not be meditating. The realization that one's \"true self\" is that of a pure meditative awareness as opposed to the self-image, literally is SR but phrased differently. (Talking about a \"true self\" can get tricky though because the moment you say it, it becomes a thought which is not what the \"true self\" is. This is what Jamie means by \"you can't think about yourself.\" )\n\nAs for whether self-inquiry as you understand it to be impossible: what is your understanding of what self-inquiry is? Based on that I can try to give a better answer.","timestamp":"2025-10-01T14:22:36.032000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1421787656307609700","message_id":"1422898949039194112","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":26,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1422360299855417395","channel_id":"1421787656307609700","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"sort

Maybe all of us are too close mindedly secular to \"tune into\" those insights though.","timestamp":"2025-09-29T14:34:55.977000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1421787656307609700","message_id":"1422179228669055139","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1422227170176143392","channel_id":"1421787656307609700","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Snarky answer incoming:\nWhy do you think you're the one telling people things?

I got to the point where I didn't even perceive that I had free will. I believe everyone has the same degree of free will, which is none. I don't believe in personal will beyond just cause and effect. It's worth noting that there is a difference between will and emotional resistance. SR has to do with lack of emotional resistance as opposed to lack of free will. \n\nNot really sure. I don't really think about it much. In a sense, the whole process of all those things you described are all one giant process of everything. The nature of decisions themselves don't change from SR, but the motivations for why an option is chosen do change since the self-image is no longer affecting the decisions. My stance on free will hasn't changed from SR. If anything the previous stance has been solidified. \n\nI don't know about higher realms of consciousness or insights into past lives or anything like that. SR itself as a phenomenon has nothing to do with having transcendent experiences. Personally, I do suspect that all the past life and near death experiences stuff that is suggesting something beyond materialism but I don't know what it is. Really still a long shot though. I have no idea. I've never personally had those experiences, just anecdotes from other people. \n\nAgain, not sure. There is nothing attained by SR. It's a completely subtractive phenomenon revealing the experience that was always there. I'm not sure exactly what \"imperishable being\" refers to either. The question of whether consciousness goes on for eternity is meaningless because all that exists is right now. From that perspective, a future death becomes meaningless, so maybe that's what it means. I don't know what happens to consciousness after death but I'm not worried about it.","timestamp":"2025-09-28T16:38:30.417000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1421787656307609700","message_id":"1421787656307609700","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
