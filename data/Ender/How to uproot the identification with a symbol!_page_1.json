The alien takes you and plugs some wires into your brain and says, I’m going to take over your consciousness for a second to download your memory. Ok close your eyes, and in 10 seconds I’m going to take over. Ok 3 2 1 I’m opening my eyes as a human for the first time. Huh, weird. feet huh?” and they swap back having downloaded the data and the alien says thanks, I understand you now. You might say “what, that’s it? How can you know what it’s like to be me, I had to go through years of self-improvement to get where I am now. I was bullied in school and had two terrible relationships before figuring out who I am now” “yeah I know it was in your memory” “what no, it took like half my life to go through that” “yeah dude I was literally you I know” “no but you can’t know what it was like you didn’t experience it you just sat there, what does it feel like for someone to break up with you?” “Feels bad man” “what, but it didn’t happen to you” “bro, I was literally you. I knew exactly what you know now. It’s in your memories” “what, but. You didn’t… you weren’t there”.\"\n\nDoes any identification with a memory make sense if the alien could always claim \"nonono that was me there, that wasn't actually you?\" What would make your argument for really being there stronger than the alien's?","timestamp":"2025-12-27T22:04:04.253000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1084919931419770931","username":"j41r7642","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"J41R","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1442103055322447943","message_id":"1454439221283782829","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1449480131407122666","channel_id":"1442103055322447943","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"To add on to what Jamie said:\nWhat is currently your self-image isn't actually you.
