The math mistake analogy I think is quite accurate. To add onto it, the incorrect step that leads to the self-image is the belief that you have experience of the past, and therefore really did exist in the past when that is not the case. \n\n\"Our ego is never fully consistent with reality\" \nWhile that is technically true, uncertainty in the way you see the world, like epistemology, is fundamentally different from self-inquiry. An epistemologist would conclude that there is someone who really exists as a discrete entity across time called \"me,\" but whose details are impossible to know for sure. Self-inquiry is attempting to examine what the word \"me\" means in the first place. To see whether the question \"who am I\" is any more reasonable and useful to ask than \"what is the biggest color of the alphabet?\"\n\nSelf-realization isn't realizing that you exist and can't know yourself for certain. It's realizing that the concept of \"me\" was incoherent in the first place so there isn't any point in trying to understand yourself by thinking because it's not possible.","timestamp":"2025-12-22T22:18:22.221000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-12-22T22:19:39.830000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"276007111337705472","username":"qldisc","avatar":"7661094b263126cc79c9c68cc4799660","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Tik","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1452572909078839469","message_id":"1452572909078839469","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
