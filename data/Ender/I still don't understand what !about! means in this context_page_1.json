The problem of who is who when the door opens completely disappears if there is no possibility of a self existing for a duration, since experience has no duration either (whoops gave away what I believe the answer the my own question is).","timestamp":"2026-01-26T02:29:46.183000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1462056636448378891","message_id":"1465000559084965948","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":116,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1465170661344415889","channel_id":"1462056636448378891","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Firstly I think it's good that you are not taking what I say as authority and doing the inquiry yourself. Don't take what I say as being absolutely true. I'm just some random guy on the internet. There is also the possibility that I miscommunicate something out of carelessness, like having an extra \"not\" somewhere in a sentence which messes everything up. \n\nThe point of the alien analogy was not to say that the alien is you. The point is that when you have personal identification with your own memories, you are doing literally the exact same thing that the alien is doing, which is mistaking the subject inside of the memory as yourself. You and the alien both have the exact same relationship to \"your memories\" (which aren't actually yours at all). Since it is obviously incorrect that the alien is the one who was there to experience the remembered past event, it is meant to become intuitive that you were not either. \n\nImagine that *right now* you have suddenly been placed in Schro Cat's body with all of its functions and memories fully intact. What I am saying is that is actually what your direct experience is, so it makes no sense for you to have a personal relationship with past events you did not experience.","timestamp":"2026-01-26T02:25:07.219000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1462056636448378891","message_id":"1465000391103090818","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":115,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1463562757319430259","channel_id":"1462056636448378891","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"There

Whether that helps for other people I dont know. \n\ni think the reason meditation is helpful is that it slows down the processes of the mind so they become easier to examine. Kind of like putting a video on 0.5x speed.","timestamp":"2026-01-20T18:26:00.917000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"906167118695899206","username":"nymandus66","avatar":"deb0228b32575931caccf30cf90870ab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nymandus","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"283467363729408000","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HK","badge":"b6f6582eb0301ce069e00b2a99323975"}},{"id":"1135121138545066095","username":"itsneekeetah","avatar":"f42f13524c5220149866d9b953093a7e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"itsneekeetah","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1462056636448378891","message_id":"1463010985962115193","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":32,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1462518919519797472","channel_id":"1462056636448378891","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"honestly not sure\ni just sat down with my eyes closed the same time every night and my mind just became clearer.\nwhen i say i reccomend people do meditation im trying to get other people the same mysterious benefit that i got. i noticed that it was extremely important to make it the same time every day because it forced me to be aware of how i was spending my time throughout the day to make sure i actually could respect my own meditation time slot. \n\ni think meditation reduces mental activity and increases awareness in some connected way that i dont know how to explain. thats very helpful for inquiry because when certain mental processes cease, it becomes infinitely easier to understand some of the stuff jamie says like \"thought is just another sensory perception occurring now\" because you literally just observe it to be true. \n\nthe biggest thing for me personally was when i could *literally directly observe/feel* that it wasnt possible to think about myself. im guessing that feeling was caused by the \"this thought is me!\" thought pattern temporarily shutting off and for the first time i could clearly see what a thought actually is without any identification on top. on this server we do a lot of logical arguing but i think that for nearly all people that is almost completely useless for self-realization. the type of understanding that self-realization actually is, is not one that can be thought about or explained.","timestamp":"2026-01-18T18:48:02.701000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1462056636448378891","message_id":"1462430957620695152","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":18,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1462250269789392896","channel_id":"1462056636448378891","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"from your perspective or just from first person perspective?

The alien takes you and plugs some wires into your brain and says, I’m going to take over your consciousness for a second to download your memory. Ok close your eyes, and in 10 seconds I’m going to take over. Ok 3 2 1 I’m opening my eyes as a human for the first time. Huh, weird. feet huh?” and they swap back having downloaded the data and the alien says thanks, I understand you now. You might say “what, that’s it? How can you know what it’s like to be me, I had to go through years of self-improvement to get where I am now. I was bullied in school and had two terrible relationships before figuring out who I am now” “yeah I know it was in your memory” “what no, it took like half my life to go through that” “yeah dude I was literally you I know” “no but you can’t know what it was like you didn’t experience it you just sat there, what does it feel like for someone to break up with you?” “Feels bad man” “what, but it didn’t happen to you” “bro, I was literally you. I knew exactly what you know now. It’s in your memories” “what, but. You didn’t… you weren’t there”.\"\n\nDoes any identification with a memory make sense if the alien could always claim \"nonono that was me there, that wasn't actually you?\" What would make your argument for really being there stronger than the alien's? \n\nThis isn't to say that you can't be sure who was there. It's to say that the question of \"who was there\" isn't coherent in the first place. You don't ask \"who was there\" when you experience the sense perception of vision.
