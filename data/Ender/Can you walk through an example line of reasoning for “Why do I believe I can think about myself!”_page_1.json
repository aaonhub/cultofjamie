Right now you experience 'me now.' Right *now* you experience 'me now' and you are a different person since the last time I said that. 10 years from now there will be a person who will experience 'me now' but that person is also not you.\" \n\nAnd at some point include the alien analogy to explain why the past person is not you.","timestamp":"2025-12-13T18:12:59.500000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1436330362585485394","message_id":"1449414595058864254","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1445564150402125844","channel_id":"1436330362585485394","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Ask yourself what your direct perception of time actually is.

The construct is a result of believing there to be a continuity of experiencing \"my life\", when there isn't actually any continuity at all. \n\nAs for advice, usually I tell everyone to meditate on time. That's what I found most helpful. \nInquiring into emotions can also clarify what you really believe. If your thoughts conflict with your emotions, the emotions are what you believe and the thoughts are you trying to lie to yourself. I think it's also important to understand that believing there to be a \"me\" who can acquire SR *is itself* a result of the self-image. SR is not a process of becoming. It's a realization of what there is right now. The SR realization occurred to me a few days after I gave up on trying to actively do self-inquiry. I bet that's not a coincidence. \nTldr: my advice is to inquire into time, inquire into emotions, and remember that acquiring SR isn't possible","timestamp":"2025-11-08T17:04:54.760000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1069551628409110571","username":"720jetski","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jeff","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1436330362585485394","message_id":"1436577749828636765","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"},{"id":"1436422752536891533","channel_id":"1436330362585485394","author":{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The key misunderstanding is in the perception of time. The self-image is a collection of memories believed to be about your past. To be able to think about yourself, you would have to be able to think about the past. However, when you recall a memory, that is a sensory perception occurring *right now* with no real relationship with the past. Another way of thinking of it is that you can't actually prove the past happened, which means you have no direct experience of it. Thoughts about the past are still thoughts that occur \"now\". \n\nThe realization results from a direct insight into your perception of time and thought, not from logical reasoning. SR is not an intellectual belief so the understanding cannot come from reason alone. \n\nIn Jamie's his original walkthrough essay he described the \"So am I, so that can't be you\" game, which demonstrates that any attempt to understand yourself intellectually can never be what you really are, because it could also apply to someone else. That is a good starting point for tearing down the intellectual answer to the question \"who am I\". \n\nMy personal recommendation is always just to tell everyone to inquire into their perception of time, because that is *the crux* of the phenomenon. Without understanding time, none of this makes sense .","timestamp":"2025-11-07T18:31:11.649000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1069551628409110571","username":"720jetski","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jeff","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1436330362585485394","message_id":"1436330401852559431","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"aspectofthenerd"}]
