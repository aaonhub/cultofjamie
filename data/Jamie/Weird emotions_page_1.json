This might not relate at all, but an example that is common for a lot of people is feeling you fucked up the day, didn't do the work you're meant to do, fumbled that bag socially, and goofed up your diet or workout, then at 1am you are lying in bed and come up with all the great ideas you are going to execute tomorrow to not only get back on track but further ahead. This thought, at the moment, seems absolutely real and you genuinely believe it, causing a sense of relief as your previous problem is now solved. \n\nNot at all saying this is what you're experiencing, but the underlying relationship between emotion and thought is what \"stepping back\" is about. I've made a reference before about how self-enquiry often feels like a series of \"Tetris moments\" and you just keep expecting the next tetris moment to be the final one. This isn't the case because the tetris moment phenomenon is identical to knowledge acquisition or learning. There isn't actually a conclusion in that direct lane. Self-realization is more analogous to questioning what the game of Tetris itself is and why you started playing it at all in the first place, what is the game and why does it exist? I'm referring to self-image/self-knowledge in this case. Jokingly I'd say that the start to everyone's life is \"So anyway, I started existing...\" Self-inquiry is really about getting you to the point that you start questioning \"I have all these beliefs about myself and the world but I don't know where they really, really originated from\". \n\nIt doesn't mean what you're describing isn't worthwhile, it means that as this pattern repeats, it is important to become aware that \"yeah, this same thing keeps happening, this same pattern keeps occurring\", then you can say \"Oh, I get it. What is *that* pattern\" and that can lead you to deeper questioning.","timestamp":"2024-12-17T08:37:30.698000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-12-17T08:40:31.181000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1264037351408144497","username":"arrryan0599","avatar":"51dbde70f92b843c858e25e03310e4ca","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Arrryan","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_e08b43c436272bc2c1e6ae85e71ab884","sku_id":"1402472280596152340","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1377377712028516443","asset":"nameplates/nameplates_v2/spirit_moon/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_V2_SPIRIT_MOON_A11Y","palette":"violet"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1316794314130723006","message_id":"1316794314130723006","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
