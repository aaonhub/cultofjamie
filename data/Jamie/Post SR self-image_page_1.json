This could be described as a sense of relief from any kind of psychological struggle or \"illusion\" as people might say, but really it means any problem with living.\n\nMy most heightened experience was not from SR but months before as I resolved a deeply held belief about \"I have to be successful\". That was not \"the whole thing\" but a small and neurotic idea I had at the time and personally relevant to me.\n\nMy most straightforward explanation of self-realization is that it is the consequence and experience of realizing that reality, your life, and your experience is exactly what it is. You are desparately trying to understand and explain what your life is, but life itself is already there. Reality is already complete and exactly what is. What are you going to explain or understand other than what everything already is?","timestamp":"2025-08-13T11:02:57.874000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1027670361829036073","username":"leafsheepsolar","avatar":"cd391e8a6f399b78ffda23488f3cb908","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"leafsheepsolar","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1399804913458090116","message_id":"1399804913458090116","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
