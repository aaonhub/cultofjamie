No idea if he is genuinely self-realized or not, but I felt while others were \"circling around something\" he was a bit more like \"walking in circles\". Again, doesn't mean he doesn't know what he's talking about or that he's not helpful. As a side note, I found Alan Watts really helpful and grounding but he expressed himself to not really personally experience what he thought was being communicated.","timestamp":"2024-06-29T03:52:55.760000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"}]
