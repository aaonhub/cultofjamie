What I'm describing isn't an experienced state, concentration, or technique. If there is genuine understanding of what \"Me\" or \"I\" is, not intellectually as \"here are some things I've read about it and I believe they are probably true\" but as an actual \"oh, shit\". Then the physiological change in processing happens automatically and requires no effort. There isn't an effort to fight anxiety with a meditative karate chop, it just never arises. For what I'm trying to communicate you don't need to try to actively combat your emotions or experiences, just try to understand what the fundamental \"Me\" is that exists and has ongoing experience in your life is. Imagine you are the only human being on earth that exists, and without reference to anything you've read from others, inquire into what you actually are that is having conscious experience and how it operates.","timestamp":"2024-07-23T05:26:44.871000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"469794118814531586","username":"kaankayhan","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Kaan Kayhan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1265056934940250194","message_id":"1265056934940250194","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
