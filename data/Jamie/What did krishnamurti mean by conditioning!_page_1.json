You wouldn't give a shit because you think \"it's a video game lol\". The moment the same phrases or beliefs are replaced in our day to day experience with \"Trump\" or \"Biden\" or \"Christian\" or \"Men/Women\" or whatever, then immediately emotions get involved because we perceive a real threat in our imagination. Both a video game political argument and a real life political argument are equally imaginary, in that they both occur only in thought. It doesn't mean one isn't more important, but neither necessitates any emotional relationship and any emotional relationship is a misunderstanding of how thinking operates with regard to our self-identity.","timestamp":"2024-12-17T09:33:46.530000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1310374460108570676","message_id":"1318017273881170004","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1310513482260811810","channel_id":"1310374460108570676","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"All rhetorical, but for example, nearly everyone where I live is a left leaning progressive and thinks republicans and conservatives are regressive morons. People growing up in rural America think progressives are smug elitists. No one grows up in Alabama as a Muslim but they all think Jesus Christ and the bible are the only truth. What are your beliefs about climate change? Lock-downs? Bernies Sanders? Communism? Joe Rogan? Elon Musk? Donald Trump? Your parents? Your partner? Masculinity? Femininity? Abortion? Gun control? Andrew Tate? Trans-rights and LGBTQ+?\n\nAlmost all of these issues are western issues that are heavily conditioned/politicized and if a person has one belief they have them all. They don't realize they are conditioned because they just think \"of course I believe this, it's correct!\". J.K. is suggesting it is necessary to question your own judgment and belief down to its source, as it is just conditioning.","timestamp":"2024-11-25T07:52:42.334000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1310374460108570676","message_id":"1310374460108570676","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
