Same with dreams. Nothing you haven't heard before or might have experienced yourself, but the two interesting points are that I far more frequently realize I'm dreaming because I'm expecting a certain emotional response that just doesn't arise, while when I'm awake on a hallucinogen if I think I see a dark figure at the end of my bed, that will cause fear because I perceive physical danger and then see that it wasn't there. Just from that tidbit I would infer that if schizophrenia has any overlap with dreaming/hallucination then I would speculate that it would be a combination of those two things, as in if you *genuinely* thought something dangerous was occurring to you but it was just your brain hallucinating, that would still be scary, but if there was obviously no threat, you would probably almost immediately know \"oh, not going to have the consequences I thought\". \n\nIn short I would guess that someone with schizophrenia in a safe, modern environment would likely have their general quality of life and emotions drastically improved because the negative emotional affect from any hallucination or intrusive thought wouldn't occur, while if they were lost in a dark forest they are still going to have an ultra bad time.","timestamp":"2024-07-23T05:39:31.850000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-23T05:39:56.241000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1263068392160755776","message_id":"1265178138292518992","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1265172498224513066","channel_id":"1263068392160755776","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think it's unlikely it would prevent hallucinations or those types of things, as they're likely related to some sort of structural or chemical mishap in the brain. \n\nThat said I think there would be major differences related to the emotions you would experience as a result of schizophrenic experiences.
