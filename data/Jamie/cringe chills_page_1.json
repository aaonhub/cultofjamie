Can't really speak to it otherwise. Could be related to the fear related to embarrassment that most people experience but isn't something I've really had in the past. \n\nIf you feel genuine shame, you can get a flushed face or express it physically in other ways. That's just a means of communicating to others your present emotional state without the use of language and is part of expressing you didn't intend to cause what you did. In the case of embarrassment, that is guilt (same emotion as shame) related to ego and is the feeling of \"they/I think less of me\". In contrast, embarrassment or cringe is not experienced without self-image, but if you make an idiot out of yourself and other people communicate that you have hurt them, that will cause you to feel shame, and there is often overlap. Basically if everyone laughs at you, there isn't embarrassment, but if you have genuinely let people down or hurt them there is shame.","timestamp":"2024-06-29T04:59:54.577000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"}]
