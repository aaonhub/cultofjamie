I met some people in university who had traumatic breakdowns because they got B's in chemistry class and thought they were lifelong failures, while my entire highschool experience at a more disadvantaged catchment public school was one where being \"academic\" was the equivalent of being \"cringe\" and tryhard. A person from each of these environments are not actually affected by their experiences, but their present beliefs about themselves that are incorreclty shaped by an intellectual model of their past experiences.","timestamp":"2025-12-07T10:12:13.132000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1440440742236393472","message_id":"1440440742236393472","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":114,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
