He is pretty enigmatic and unpredictable from the bits I've looked at. My appreciation for him is more from those quotes or references as it mirrors some of my own experience of having a big wedge being driven between who I thought I was and who I was actually that caused me to even notice there were two \"Me's\" and that made no sense. A big part of his practice was forcing people into their worst fears or ego separation events in order to see that their imaginary worst fear happened but they were still actually fine, so what was actually going on in their mind? Just that part from my perspective is both very advanced and also kind of mean and hilarious.","timestamp":"2025-04-27T14:21:29.254000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1358737979467632792","message_id":"1358737979467632792","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
