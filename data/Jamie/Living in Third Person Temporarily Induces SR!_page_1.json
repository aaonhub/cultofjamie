There is something a lot deeper in there, in that even the statement \"I'm watching myself in the third person\" is kind of funny. Imagine if you said \"I swapped consciousness with another person and was no longer anxious about mistakes they made in my body!\" Worth thinking about how you became yourself in the first place haha. \n\nThe reason that he doesn't feel that anxious in the situation described is because visually he perceives the person interacting as a third party. It \"feels like\" operating a robot or drone and there is no communication occurring in relationship to visual stimulus because they aren't looking at \"you\" which would be the visual signal from the camera. If the person suddenly started staring at the camera and talking to it then he would feel very uncomfortable, even though no one is in front of his actual body.\n\nI've mentioned in my essay that your actual identity is the sensory experience. I *AM* seeing, I *AM* hearing, I *AM* touching. You are the signal. It seems novel to dissociate from your body when you're looking through vr, but it's only because you were never the body in the first place, just the signal it generates visually, spatially, and in sense perception.","timestamp":"2024-11-25T07:44:30.040000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-11-25T07:44:34.755000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1309970879547048050","message_id":"1309970879547048050","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
