When people say \"the self is an illusion!\" it is goofy because that is an intellectual conclusion and not their own experience. \n\nMany people who are not self-realized but talk *around* the subject seem to collect intellectual ideas that centre around \"who I think I am isn't actually who I am\" which is podcast fuel, but not actually really related at all to the real thing that we talk about here and is actually important.\n\nThe phenomenon itself causes you to realize \"ah, no reflection, no identity. I am just what I experience, as it always has been\". It is not a \"omg I have discovered something new!\" it is \"Ah, I don't have to worry, I'm just as it is\"","timestamp":"2024-10-08T07:18:00.518000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-08T07:22:22.320000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275814624801067072","message_id":"1281392255848153149","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1281363031443374181","channel_id":"1275814624801067072","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just nitpicking, but I would clarify that the self isn't strictly an illusion, as that implies it's like your reflection, which is that it's there, but not actually you. The realization causes the reflection/illusion to disappear, you don't just become aware your reflection isn't you.\n\nThe only reason there appears to be some insight just comes from clarity rather than extra information. Nearly every philosophy, religion, or belief someone has stems from a deeply rooted construct they have invented that they think is in some way benefitted from said belief. If that construct completely ends, then you basically automatically discard any information anyone tells you or you read that is rooted in an emotional belief and so there really just isn't much left. \n\nThe most salient is emotional understanding. Most people are very emotionally confused and don't understand what is happening to them and why because they have emotional relationship to their beliefs, causing them to experience more than one emotion at a time, which is uninterpretable and experienced as \"jealousy\" or \"greed\" or \"depression\" or some type of complex melange of emotions that must be categorized by \"describe the circumstance\" rather than the emotions themselves. If there is no emotional relationship to beliefs or a self-concept then you almost never experience emotions, and when you do it is always one at a time and absolutely obvious what they mean in the same way we all know physical pain comes from damaging yourself.","timestamp":"2024-09-05T21:19:13.270000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-09-05T21:19:19.188000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"703251615674662916","username":"mr.niceguy312","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"mr.niceguy","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275814624801067072","message_id":"1275814624801067072","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
