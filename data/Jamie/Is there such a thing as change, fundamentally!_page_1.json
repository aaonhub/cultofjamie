Our brain stores memory of past sensory experience and we call that \"the past\". We then use that to intelligently imagine and model a hypothetical \"future\" and then see if it happens and re-adjust our models of reality accordingly. \n\nThe way this occurs in our brain and our conciousness is as \"past, present, future\". The present being immediate perception, past being memory, and future being imagination. \n\nI am not saying this rhetorically, I am saying this literally. Your brain see this as three separate \"things\" to calculate and consider, and the difference between them is what we call \"time\". It's just a consideration about now, a consideration about past memory, and a consideration about future imagination. The difference btween these \"imaginations\" is time.\n\nWhat I am saying self-reatlization is, and what self-inquiry leads you to is seeing that there is no time in this imaginary inquiry. All things, all thinking, all experience occurs \"now\", and there is no need for the brain to consider past or future at all. This causes it to stop doing so and leads to what I'm trying to encourage others to investigate and then experience.","timestamp":"2025-08-13T09:43:48.378000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1379341082659389450","message_id":"1396388646902304839","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":19,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1395877468921004224","channel_id":"1379341082659389450","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"*Psychologically, I know I have once been fearful (the sensation of fear being present in experience). I am not fearful now, in this precise moment as I write this. How am I to reconcile this without time, and saying that I have changed psychologically over time to no longer be fearful? *\n\nYou can say that from a practical sense if you want. It's also just not necessary to make a statement like \"I used to be fearful but now I am not\", believe this is two states you have experienced and then try to reconcile them with some sort of measurement. If you have water in a round cup then put it in a square cup it's just the same thing taking a different shape and it seems fairly unimportant to say \"the water has changed shape over time\". \n\nWhen you say \"I was a certain way, now I am this other way\" you are inventing a self-identity by splitting yourself in thought into two categories and then comparing them. What you are comparing is idea 1 and idea 2, believing they are both you. When you were fearful in the past, this was a present moment experience of fear, and if you do or do not experience fear right now it is the exact same entity having that experience. The awareness of the sensation of fear is exactly the same in both scenarios and does not need to be reconciled as two seaparate events in thought.","timestamp":"2025-07-18T21:18:42.740000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1379341082659389450","message_id":"1388030183763738685","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":14,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1385159776778063993","channel_id":"1379341082659389450","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"To be very fundamental there is no such thing as change in reference to the idea that there is one state that then becomes another state. The state of reality as it currently is will change forms, but will still be \"the current state of reality\" and nothing has fundamentally become different. It is not possible to point to two things that are \"changes\" in the state of reality you can only say that you imagined something as different and refer to that.","timestamp":"2025-06-19T07:30:25.808000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1379341082659389450","message_id":"1379341082659389450","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
