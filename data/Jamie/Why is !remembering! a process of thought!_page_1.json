If I asked you to remember what someone said yesterday, you would recall the words they said and repeat them. If I asked you to do an impression of the person you met yesterday to give me the gist of what they were like you would suddenly have to improvise and create a novel communication, but both would be the product of thought and memory. If I asked a dog to do the same thing it would not be able to comprehend the question because it can't use human language or formulate what I'm even asking it to do because it doesn't have the human faculty for language/communication in that way. \n\nA bit of what you're asking is making things more complex than they need to be and is a bit like saying \"when I look at a photo I uploaded to the computer yesterday, it is displaying that information exactly back to me, but when I run a video game, it seems like that is a new, dynamic interaction I'm involved with\", and yes, sort of, in that the actual experience of viewing a photo and playing a video game is different because of other factors playing into it, but a photo on the computer is data stored on the hard drive, and a video game is also data stored on the hard drive. The monitor, when asked, then displays the data in accordance to whatever other demands/operations are going on. The root commonality between the two is memory/thought, but other observed characteristics are due to how intelligence interacts with it and what you are trying to do with it.","timestamp":"2024-07-16T05:11:22.113000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1261516982432432248","message_id":"1261516982432432248","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
