Any actor or physical being only does or \"did\" one thing and all actions are linear.

An example is that pain is physical, hunger is physical, and our sensory perceptions are physical. They are all in some way related to an actual event that is taking place physically that causes a response by the body. I'm probably wording this a bit sloppily, but just think of a plant vs. a dog vs. a human. With plant, absolutely everything is physical. If you put it in the right physical conditions, it will grow well and if you don't it suffers. If you take a dog, it is sort of like that in many ways, but also if you treat it poorly from a social perspective, the dog will be dislike you, be unhappy, sad etc. With a human, they have the additional layer of being capable of literally inventing a fantasy of how their life should be, and feeling emotionally distressed if they are not experiencing that imaginary state, which most animals, even intelligent ones, are not sufficiently capable of experiencing. \n\nSelf-realization to some degree is akin to being a perfectly normal human with all of our capacities, but a reversion to the natural state of being \"plant-like\" in that everything you do is just a physical response to your environment and nature.","timestamp":"2025-05-02T15:15:20.576000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-05-02T15:28:03.241000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1360525221039181854","message_id":"1366545225140408430","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1366066316741447871","channel_id":"1360525221039181854","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"2. What do you mean when you say “consciousness” and “awareness of sensory experience” are different things\n\nIt is often circumstantial how I'd reference it, but \"consciousness\" usually references the objective characteristic we intuit as \"yeah, other people are \"conscious\"\" and cows are \"conscious\", whereas dandelions are probably not. That is the objective characteristic of awareness and executive control of the body.\n\nAwareness of sensory experience is the subjective awareness you are currently experiencing as \"Me\".\n\nIt's not really a scientific mystery that there is probably many individually conscious intelligent creatures on planet earth. All of us humans sort of assume each other is conscious and we assume that intelligent mammals are also conscious. What is not resolvable as far as I've been able to understand is why \"I\" am experiencing my own individual subjective awareness. This used to be referred to as the \"soul\" but it is really just \"yeah, objectively I get that consciousness may be produced by the intelligent brain, but why do I exist inside this one?\" The recognition of *what I actually am* that I call \"Me\" is the awareness of sensory experience.\n\n3. What is your definition of emotion and how can crying at non-physical stimuli not be caused by emotion?\n\nCrying is a form of communication it isn't an emotion. It occurs in conjunction with an emotion for most people the same way frustration and anger are the same thing for most people but they are completely different. Anger is an emotion that is caused by the perception you or another has been wronged by another unintelligently, but frustration is a lack of communication between you and another person. If there is an active self-image, these are basically the same thing, but if there isn't, they are basically never connected. \n\nWhen I cry now it is 99% of the time related to someone else experiencing joy or happy novelty, like when people wear those \ncolour blind glasses and are really happy. Same thing when someone struggles and then succeeds, etc. I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything, but I cry because it is an expression of \"oh, that is a really good thing that we should be encouraging in our society\". It is very similar to laughter at something that is funny. I don't feel happy when I laugh, I am already happy, it is an automatic expression of \"oh, that is an intelligent expression of novelty for our culture/common ideas\".","timestamp":"2025-04-27T14:59:50.196000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1360525221039181854","message_id":"1361893697758826586","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1366062217685897348","channel_id":"1360525221039181854","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"\"I logically understand that the signal cannot be thought about.
