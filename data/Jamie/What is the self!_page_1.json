It isn't about yourself at all it is just knowledge. There's nothing wrong with measuring your intelligence, or height, or anything like that, but it has no personal utility for you, it is only necessary to communicate information that might be useful to other people. You don't need to know how smart you are, you are experiencing it all the time. You only need to know in order to use that information to get into a school, job, or compare yourself to others objectively in order to figure out how to act intelligently. You aren't finding anything *new* about yourself, you are just trying to convert it into the form of thought in order to communicate to others or solve a problem with that information. \n\nIt isn't that it might not be useful, but it is not yourself. As an example, imagine you swap consciousness with a dog for a minute, then measured yourself, you would say \"this dog is 2 feet long\". Someone would say \"no, you mean you're 2 feet long\" and you'd be like \"no I'm over there, I'm just in this dog for a minute to measure it\". You can only control the dog, you can only experience what the dog is experiencing, you have absolutely no relationship at all to the human you were a second ago, but the ego remains as a structure that says \"I am that thing over there\". If you tried to switch consciousness back and couldn't, and are now stuck as the dog permanently, would you then say \"ok I guess I am now the dog\"?

When I talk about how you need a model of my life because you don't have my memories, I'm referring to a slightly different thing, which is when I'm telling you a story, or what I did on the weekend, you need to consciously build that dataset with your own memories to contemplate my life. This is just a normal use of thinking to exchange and remember information. \n\nWhat J.K. or I am referring to with regard to it not being necessary to create an image of another or yourself, that refers to deeply held beliefs about another. It is what causes us to hold grudges, resent our partners or parents, etc. When a wife says to her husband \"can you take out the trash\" and he says \"in a minute\" and then she fucking loses it, this is because she isn't interacting with his rejection, she is interacting with the image of \"who she thinks he is\" and is furious because she feels a lifetime of being taken for granted and being unappreciated. That is the \"image\" that we make of others and we do the same thing for ourselves. \n\nThe \"knowing\" J.K. is referring to that occurs in the present is again like the rolled up intelligent response of all of our memories responding to the present circumstance (like kicking a ball), but without an image. Just from my own perspective, an example is perception of status. Even among my own peers/friends I've had various points in my life where you can automatically sense an attitude of reverence or disappointment based on their perception of you at the time. This perception is not based on your immediate behaviour, but what the behaviour means for their \"image\" of you they've invented. When you are describing how much weight you lift or a remembered fact, yes it is correct that this isn't \"You\", but if you develop it into an identity that perhaps you aren't very strong, and then your crush says \"they're really weak\" then suddenly you perceive an identity and are hurt that it is attacked. That is the more important part, not that you remember a fact about what you can lift, there is no problem with that part.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T07:23:07.594000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"721388489115172924","username":"river_rafter","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"riverrafter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1287565052739584031","message_id":"1311190221974671441","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":29,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1310501054340796487","channel_id":"1287565052739584031","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> Now if you're hinting at the origin of preferences themselves it's pretty obscure to me, they just are.\n\nYeah that's great, look into this more, that's where subjectivity and the awareness of \"Me\" comes from.","timestamp":"2024-11-25T07:03:19.287000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"721388489115172924","username":"river_rafter","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"riverrafter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1287565052739584031","message_id":"1308939115231707197","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":17,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1306310789497487371","channel_id":"1287565052739584031","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You're still engaging with the content of your thoughts as you believe them to be objective facts about the world that you think are true, rather than asking yourself \"how do I myself form my knowledge of what I think is true?\" \n\nI am hinting at examining subjectivity by saying \"I like banana ice cream more than chocolate\", which to you is a *fact*. Why? How do you know this is true? How are you able to tell which ice cream you prefer?\n\nFor example, you are essentially asking a question akin to \"What is the meaning of life?\" The reason someone asks this is because there is already a psychological desire for meaning and a demand to find the perfect course of action so you can act without stifling or error. You can argue with someone on the \"answer\" to this question for eternity, and no philosopher can agree because when they decide \"it's all about love\" or \"it's about power\" or whatever, the only way they get there is by refining their own beliefs down to a single point and saying \"well, can't get more precise than that, there's the answer\", not realizing they only view that answer as correct because it explains their own subjective experience.

Loneliness is a \"craving\" or \"desire\" in that is always a desire for our self-image being loved, rather than the actual thing happening. \n\n*So the desire for stability for me is not so obvious. I think it's because it's really conditioned in our roles as humans as being able to provide. Probably the thing that will focus in our lives the most is being able to have a career or to keep a job. You even see people crossing continents even deciding to settle in Canada of all places thanks to Justin Trudeau (I've been reading Canadian Reddit lately  and it's amazing) to improve their life situation. So it's kind of hard for me to see this as pathological. Poverty is a reality, it sucks and kills. It really limits the things that you can do in life. *\n\n\nI can't address all of this directly intellectually, as it is points to a number of things. I hope that it is apparent that what you're addressing is a number of things that you think are important or true, and how they might be resolved. I want to \"zoom-out\" and look at the big picture in your own subjective structure of experience - engaging directly with what you experience moment to moment. \n\nI am not saying these are not serious problems, I am saying they are serious problems in your own cognitive view of the world. I am encouraging you and others to examine that structure itself. What is your own experience? Why is it the case?

Krishamurti, Ramana Maharshi, and I think it is also helpful to contrast them with stoic philosophers and the old school \"how to live\" philosophers who were basically trying to establish the same thing but intellectually. If you want a more grounded/modern angle I'd probably listen to J.K., U.G, Alan Watts, and Adyashanti.

Self-image and the desire to fulfill the wants of it manifests itself as insecurity, and whenever it arises will create this forked motivation.

The reason this is important is because unless you actually verbalize and think your own thoughts you won't actually realize that's what you believe. From that place you can then \"zoom out\" because some of the things you think or feel will obviously not make sense or be hypocritical, and you will think \"huh, that's weird\" and be able to resolve it. It is again why talk-therapy is essentially just surface level self-inquiry. It works because talk-therapy actually forces you to become aware of what you currently think and the instant you verbalize it you recognize the errors in your own ideas and automatically correct them.","timestamp":"2024-09-23T01:27:08.659000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-09-23T01:41:01.178000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1287586010389155902","channel_id":"1287565052739584031","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"To be perfectly honest I had no idea what I was trying to understand other than listening to a bunch of people seemingly talking cryptically about a different way of perceiving or understanding conscious experience. At first I thought I was learning how subjective emotions work and thought \"oh this is neat I've never heard anyone teach that\" but really it largely just became \"what the f are these people trying to say and how can all of them be saying the same thing?\" \n\nI think the main sort of seed I had in my mind that made it easier was a certainty around the idea that the way I currently conceptualized my life was completely wrong, didn't actually work, and I had to be missing something. There was already some awareness that the way I cognitively conceptualized my life and ambitions had to be structurally wrong somehow. I had a pretty good idea of what I *wasn't* looking for compared to a lot of people so I think that made the whole thing a bit more direct.\n\n*What is the self, really?*\n\nThe self is your awareness of present perception. Everyone knows this, the problem is that your self is *not* anything else because everything else is within it. When you experienced the past, it was as present perception, when you think of the past that thought is present perception, thinking of the future is a present perception, and when the future occurs it will be as present perception. The problem is that we conventionally believe our present sensory experience is sandwiched between the past and the future like a bead on a string, but what must be realized is how this is not possible because the only way we can conceptualize the past and future is within present sensory experience and so neither actually exists or is ever experienced. \n\nThere only appears to be a big difference between insults to our appearance or intelligence and questions like \"what is time?\" because we view them objectively as separate pieces of information rather than seeing their interconnectedness in the subjective way we experience them. Subjectively, none of them are actual objects, but measurements we use to evaluate things. If you follow your own insecurity, it directly leads you right away to your beliefs about time because there is always a perception there is some form of problem that must then be resolved through time in some way. \n\n1. There isn't really such a thing as zooming in or zooming out, but it's just a decent mental cue that can help prevent you getting too bogged down in details. What we are zooming out to is baseline conscious experience rather than zooming into a narrow band of complex thought. It might be more helpful to use a cue like \"just be really fucking honest with yourself\" so you can actually see what you're working with. As an example, if someone were to ask themselves \"why do I want to make a lot of money?\" they might \"zoom-in\" and start talking about how they were raised, or how they want to achieve xyz, or how social status is linked to money and others treat you better, but if you were just \"really fucking honest with yourself\" that person might say \"Yeah I want to make a lot of money because I think girls like that and I want to get a hot girlfriend so I don't feel so lonely all the time\". Suddenly there is awareness of \"oh, I put other people down and try to make more money than them all because I'm really lonely\". This is a small example, but the way an insight can actually result in new understanding that changes behaviour.","timestamp":"2024-09-23T01:27:07.068000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-09-23T01:39:16.496000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1287565052739584031","message_id":"1287565052739584031","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
