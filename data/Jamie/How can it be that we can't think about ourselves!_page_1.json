There is no such \"Object\" that exists under scrutiny. \n\nSeparately, to make it clear, I used to experience nightmares and bad dreams, and now no matter what I dream there are no emotions and no connection to it. It is a qualitatively different experience of dreaming and that extends to thinking and waking experience. There are no bad thoughts or emotional relationship to other's beliefs or ideas or my own. There is complete contentment and peace regardless of idea or speech. It is then subjectively perceived as \"oh my god, this is how it is supposed to be how could I have ever lived differently\".","timestamp":"2025-08-13T09:48:34.658000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"776884386372255755","username":"q__c_","avatar":"9da34bdb46f23c4e74ef91e6b87fde84","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Q-C","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1386407013340414043","message_id":"1396181406585061546","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":30,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1395851925148274759","channel_id":"1386407013340414043","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The reason people are not self-realized is they specifically don't understand how thinking operates subjectively and believe that thoughts contain content, particularly the past and future and themselves.","timestamp":"2025-07-18T19:37:12.630000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1386407013340414043","message_id":"1386407633975640155","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1395851591592181881","channel_id":"1386407013340414043","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"*It actually appears to me that consciousness is the one thing we can be sure exists, and every thought you have is about that thing, basically.* \n\nThis is the recursion that creates ego/self-image. The literal structure that creates emotional relationship to an imagined self-identity is the unresolved belief that I have conciousness, within that conciousness is thought, thought can then contain conciousness. \n\nThe only structure that is actually true is that consciousness contains thinking. You cannot think about conciousness because the thoughts are appearing in conciousness. The fase belief is \"yeah sure, but what I'm imagining is a future or past conscious experience\" this is false, you are just thinking, and once again thinking occurs within conciousness right now.","timestamp":"2025-07-18T19:35:53.104000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1386407013340414043","message_id":"1386407013340414043","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
