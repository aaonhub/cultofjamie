This is the sort of \"zooming out\" being referred to previously. It might be helpful to think of your senses as an orchestra, and each is its own section/instrument. Seeing is the piano, hearing is the woodwind, touch is percussion, etc. Thought maybe in this case is the melody or music being played. Because it is a bit abstract we don't observe it, and mistake it for just \"being the thing that is happening\" when it is just another sense or part of the orchestra.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T05:20:25.026000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1272440827406319646","message_id":"1325291150390722654","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1281364611903258677","channel_id":"1272440827406319646","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah you're doing all the right things, don't stress yourself too much.\n\nI've been using this a bit recently, but I think it's helpful to use the \"thought is a hologram\" analogy a bit more. Imagine you are on a spaceship and have a hologram generator. The hologram generator will appear as anything you ask it to. This is exactly how thought operates. \n\nIf you ask the hologram \"I want you to show me what the future looks like\" it says \"I can't do that\". But if you ask \"Well, I'm going to the beach tomorrow, show me the beach\" and it will show you a beach. You might then say \"see, you can show me the future!\" and the hologram would say \"what are you talking about I am just showing you a beach\". \n\nNo matter what you ask the hologram to show you, it is never the past or the future or the thing, it is always just a hologram, right here, right now. If you examine how thought operates and see it works the same way, there is the primary realization that you have literally never been able to conceptualize or think about the past or future at all and have never experienced either.","timestamp":"2024-09-05T21:25:30.081000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1272440827406319646","message_id":"1281357379774054473","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1281354149996396664","channel_id":"1272440827406319646","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yo sorry dude, \n\nI think the analysis vs. understanding is a bit open to interpretation which was causing a lot of my initial difficulty really drawing a distinction. In the spirit of \"don't analyze, understand\" what is really meant is that the objective isn't to draw a conclusion based on rationale and logic, because then all you can do is \"believe\" your conclusion, kind of like a life philosophy. You aren't trying to come up with an idea that you can no longer criticize,  instead the realization must be \"understood\" because then it is seen as obviously true and results in permanent, non-conscious change. \n\nthis isn't a great analogy, but it's like if I were to ask you what 2 + 2 is, and then said \"is it 7?\" you would say \"no\" and then if I said \"Is it 4?\" you would be like \"yes\". How did you know it was 4? Essentially you just *know* that it's 4 because that's how you've learned and understood numbers to work. In the same way you don't need to analyze or believe that you are in pain when I hit you with a stick, it is a direct and immediately understood automatic experience. When you eat broccoli and then eat fish and chips and say \"I like fish and chips more\" there is no analyzing you had to do you're directly verbalizing a memory or experience you had. \n\nSelf-realization is really about correctly identifying what conscious experience itself is as you experience it, and that is the identity \"Me\" refers to. You aren't trying to weigh and measure the opinion of 50 different philosophers or neuroscientists to analyze the commonalities or extract a logical conclusion, you are looking at your own direct experience of consciousness and being like \"what is it that I am experiencing?\" When you correctly identify it the change is automatic because you essentially immediately are like \"oh yeah, that is what I am experiencing\"","timestamp":"2024-09-05T20:43:55.768000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-09-05T22:20:34.378000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1272440827406319646","message_id":"1272440827406319646","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
