It results in instantly seeing \"oh, I don't need beliefs to act\". And that causes emotional and perceptual change. \n\nRamana speaks on the same subject, but he is in some way \"the mystic's mystic\" in that he he speaks like every word is going to be poetry or biblical, but he is fundamentally just trying to say the same thing, which is the cessation of emotional relationship to self-imagination.","timestamp":"2024-08-26T08:13:57.082000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"104988085170741248","username":"crthha","avatar":"a9565919737a11de3b13a4db01165cc5","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Craig","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1268936685127860235","message_id":"1268936685127860235","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
