Just like a video game, there isn't some permanent object/room that we then move around in, the whole video game changes instantly with each interaction and that new state is then displayed to yourself and everyone. Instead of saying \"I will walk over there\" like a video game avatar moving within a fixed space, it is instead the transformation of the entire thing that causes it to appear differently. In this way consciousness plays in each individual, wherein we aren't just \"moving our bodies around\" in a room or space, but instead what we are individually is the awareness and capacity to transform a local piece of reality. In a more practical sense, our conventional view of \"I'm a person doing people things in a place called the Earth\" is fine, but whether you come at it with a subjective lens or a more physics based lens, you can't avoid observing that it's really an information system of some sort, not really about discrete large objects. This can be realized from an intellectual level, but also as a \"yes of course\" type of way subjectively. \n\nIt is similar to the Alan Watts type quote of \"You are the universe experiencing itself\" but not the \"yeah yeah, we all come from stardust or something so I guess my body is made of that\", but instead a direct look at the role of consciousness in the global system/universe that is of course what you are.","timestamp":"2025-01-15T07:20:55.062000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1328239652515221526","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":151,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1328234609892397116","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"If you want a conceptual extreme, it's as simple as observing how the physical world is when you are born, and how it will be radically transformed by conscious beings by the time you die. That's a pretty crude but \"objective\" way of looking at it, but if you just look at your own fundamental experience as a human being, it is observably the case you are motivationally forced by your own biology to expand and act upon your own innate wants and preferences at every moment of your life that continually escalate and change in nature according to your age/growth. \n\nWhen you say \"consciousness could just not exist and nothing would change\" that is a completely different assertion and really has no relationship. If the curiosity is \"we can build a robot that presumably isn't conscious, but could physically do the same tasks that a human does entirely\" then yeah, sure, maybe. What is the significance of that? The original premise is not \"is consciousness needed to physically transform things creatively\" it is just the case it does seem to exist for complex organic operations that way. We are trying to understand and recognize our own innate being, not speculate on if physical tasks could be accomplished in certain ways by a non-conscious algorithmic process. If we were questioning the role of consciousness in that way, you can draw the line of reasoning back to why does the universe exist with any particular laws at all. Why is the speed of light what it is? Why does gravity exist? Why does anything exist? The idea of consciousness as an object for utility is fairly inconsequential, but the resolution of \"what am I?\" is everything because it resolves your relationship to it all without need for further answers.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T05:30:08.404000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1319020760731226165","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":149,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1319917285359485019","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yes, but it is important to realize that it isn't \"I am experiencing my sensory perceptions\" but you are only the signal generated.

With that said, what \"You\" fundamentally are is the awareness of the signal generated by the interaction between the human organism and its environment. You are sensory perception itself and not the objects creating it. It's basically just matter interacting with matter and \"Me\" is itself the interaction in-between and aware of it. You can sort of express it like \"you are not particle A, and you are not particle B, but when they collide and interact, you are the interaction they create not either particle\". Just expand that to your body and the rest of the world. The concept of \"duality\" is falsely created in our minds because our awareness itself is seemingly composed of two pieces, and we assume that we are one of the two or both, when we are actually just the interaction. \n\nThe entity that processes this interaction, which we call consciousness or \"Me\" seems to have a novel transformative role that modifies the interaction between these two objects and we interpret that as agency or free will. It is not explicitly \"choice\" at all, but a form of creation, as you aren't choosing between anything, you are spontaneously creating the next moment of reality without choice. So yes, you are sort of just \"becoming aware of the human being enlightening itself\", but that doesn't mean \"I'm just watching it happen\" you are actively creating it.","timestamp":"2024-11-14T05:03:30.670000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1304444346472595538","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":142,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1306479157563101234","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Lol, no, in that when you think of the burger king nearby, the image is the same as \"the burger king I went to yesterday\" and \"the burger king I am going to tomorrow\" or when someone says \"I went to a burger king recently\" the image in your mind is identical in all cases (generally) but the meaning you interpret is different.

There is no observer who then sees an object, there is only the awareness of the signal generated between their interaction. \n\nWhen you look at a tree, what you are aware of is the signal generated in your eyes and conveyed to your consciousness. Because it has concrete and consistent behaviour, it is helpful to label that object \"a tree\" and use it for communication with other people who seem to experience it roughly exactly the same way. The way we typically understand this phenomenon is that \"I\" am the human being walking around looking at stuff, and the tree is an external object we have observed. What is actually happening is that the human being we are is a physical object, the tree is a physical object, and \"I\" is the awareness of the sense perception generated between their interaction in some way. \n\nWhen J.K. says \"the word is not the thing\" he isn't usually talking about this sort of non-dual component, he is trying to express \"you are trying really hard to intellectually understand what I'm saying, but intellectually understanding what I'm saying is not actually getting the point\". He is doing this because the usual trap of nearly everyone is to try to accumulate and refine their ideas and knowledge as if they were going to be quizzed on it and given a grade by someone else. The realization comes from directly understanding what \"I\" refers to in your own conscious experience and not through intellectual understanding that someone else can say \"correct!\".","timestamp":"2024-09-22T20:24:59.145000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1282776856826871823","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":132,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1281358633795326033","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Thoughts can only represent or appear as things, like a hologram, but they do not contain any things.
