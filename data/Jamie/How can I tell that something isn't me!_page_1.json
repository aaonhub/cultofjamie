For me it was mostly \"thinking about it\" like analysis or talk therapy, then the final lightbulb moment was a realization in thought that triggered it. Others who sort of arrive there through formal meditation it seems more akin to an observation, but they are forms of realizing like \"*OH* this is what I am\".","timestamp":"2025-07-18T22:00:36.328000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1382006544069296169","message_id":"1395880347031310478","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1395849333336838307","channel_id":"1382006544069296169","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"When I say 'ever' I mean it has never been interrupted. \n\n*So what should I possibly answer to this question?*\n\nYou can tell something isn't yourself because you will not be satisfied with the answer and not perceive it as correct.

It's exactly like me asking \"look at the person who's seeing\" or \"what does sound itself sound like?\"\n\nBecause we haven't seen this limitation human being instead invent philosophy, religion, and spirituality to try to intellectually resolve self-identity when there isn't actually one. You have to realize, observe, or have the thoughts that lead you to see *why* there is no thought based identity that you've invented for yourself and can never be one for it to dissolve automatically.","timestamp":"2025-07-18T19:26:54.694000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1382006544069296169","message_id":"1385359000614473879","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1385179563742728193","channel_id":"1382006544069296169","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"*the task you gave your disciples is simple* \n\nkms don't ever say that I hate all of you (jk, unless...?)\n\n\"You gave an example: You're not a central banker, a central banker is an abstraction of you and your social identity, it's your self image.\"\n\nTru baybeee. \n\nTo actually respond to what you're saying, there are no metrics that define \"Me-ness\".
