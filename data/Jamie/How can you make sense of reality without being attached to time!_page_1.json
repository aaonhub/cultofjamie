It's like thinking about the past or the future, in that it's not possible to actually think about either because neither is real, you can only conjure up an idea in your head and misinterpret it as an abstraction of something real. When you think of \"the future\" there is a belief that this thought points to an actual real thing called \"the future\" but if you look around you in actual reality such a thing does not exist. You will never interact with nor encounter it. \"The future\" or \"the past\" doesn't point to anything at all, the thought itself is the only thing that is real.","timestamp":"2024-11-14T17:31:06.859000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1264037351408144497","username":"arrryan0599","avatar":"51dbde70f92b843c858e25e03310e4ca","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Arrryan","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_e08b43c436272bc2c1e6ae85e71ab884","sku_id":"1402472280596152340","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1377377712028516443","asset":"nameplates/nameplates_v2/spirit_moon/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_V2_SPIRIT_MOON_A11Y","palette":"violet"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1288301671910477844","message_id":"1306584642148630568","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":36,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1306308466465439905","channel_id":"1288301671910477844","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah, I'm suggesting that there are no objects in photographs, the only object is the photograph. If a kid draws a terrible drawing of a person, we can't even recognize it. If a good artist draws a picture of a celebrity, we'll recognize it as \"oh, I think that's Keanu Reeves right??\" and they're like \"yeah\". Then if you have a photograph we are like \"that is definitely keanu reaves\". Then if you have a memory of meeting keanu reaves we view that memory in thought as \"that was *definitely* keanu reeves\". In all scenarios, they are abstractions of Keanu Reeves and literally none of them are ineractions with the real person. \n\nIt is just that it is very easy to realize a bad drawing doesn't represent an actual human, it is tricky to realize that a photograph doesn't represent an actual human, and extremely difficult to understand why you can't actually even think about an actual human. The answer is the same in all cases, which is you are looking at an *object* which is the drawing, the photo, or the thought, and *those* are what is real, there is nothing inside of them. \n\n\"Do all senses work the same way? Like we never see objects we just see and all objects  in vision are actually the same thing?\" All you are is your senses, check and see how they work as part of your self-inquiry.","timestamp":"2024-11-13T17:23:28.443000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1288301671910477844","message_id":"1299179100812083224","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":34,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1295948720621359134","channel_id":"1288301671910477844","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"To give a sort of basic analogy, it is the difference between looking at a photograph and saying “it’s a boat, it’s a plane!

There is no loss of function or some sort of ethereal \"Who I thought I was must die so the new me can emerge!\". \n\nWhat fundamentally changes is not your capacity to judge or evaluate the past or future (or yourself) but there is a change in relationship to those concepts in thought because you realize they don't actually affect \"you\" in the way you thought they did before. \n\nBeing really basic here, an analogy with ego/self-image present would be if you dated Taylor Swift, then you broke up with her and she wrote a song called \"fuck my ex he's a bitch\". As you're listening to the song you are thinking the whole time she is singing about you, trashing you, and you're thinking \"wow, this is really bullshit: I was a really good partner and she was the one that was insane. I can't believe she's saying this trash about me\" and you get really mad. After fuming about it for a few days, she then does an interview and says \"yeah that's about my ex Capybara\" and it's not you. Suddenly there is relief and embarrassment that you mistakenly thought she was singing about you. Self-realization does not negate the misunderstanding from occurring, but it completely negates the emotional error from occurring because what you imagine is happening (omg she is singing about me) no longer has an effect. You might still intellectually be in error in that you think she was singing about you, but there is no emotional error because there is no relationship to a self-concept and so you don't get upset, but you still intelligently respond to what you think is happening.","timestamp":"2024-10-07T06:00:27.415000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-07T09:17:57.353000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1288301671910477844","message_id":"1288301671910477844","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":23,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
