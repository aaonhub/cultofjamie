I don't have emotional problems at all and so \"mindfulness\" is completely delusional from my pov, but I see where it comes from and have been interested in it in the past.\n\nThere is only relief from \"mediation\" for someone if they have problems with their regular lives and thoughts. \n\nI have never done \"mindfulness meditation\", but it might be useful to some people depending on their circumstances, but it is not profound or exclusive, it is a form of self-help.\n\nUsing someone else as a scapegoat, but Ramana Maharshi has said \"I see formal meditation as something for amateurs\".\n\nThis is a nice way of me saying any \"meditation\" you do is just whatever you think it is. What are you doing? What are you accomplishing?\" \n\nThe purpose of meditation originally was to say \"you have problems with who you are and what your life is right? Well, no one is going to come and save you, so figure it out yourself over there in the corner\"\n\nThis is harsh, but actually real and has resolution in self-realization. The idea that sitting and \"meditating\" does something is nonsensical to me because I know what is supposed to lead to, and I also know what most people wrongly think it is.","timestamp":"2025-08-13T11:28:23.810000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1402981136195518564","message_id":"1402981136195518564","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
