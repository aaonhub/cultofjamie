We are worried about our imagined selves because something might happen that changes our opinion of our imagined selves. \n\nTake our actual real life concerns. You ask out a girl or boy and are anxious. You are anxious because the perception is that a physically bad event might occur, which is they say \"uh, sorry, not interested\". We think we are worried about this actual physical event occurring but this not true. What happens if that occurs? Do you die? Are you physically hurt? No. Nothing actually happens. The only thing happens is your beliefs about yourself and your life, which are \"well, maybe my imagined future has this attractive person in my life, that would be great!\" and then when they say \"Uh, no\" then suddenly that imagined future collapses. The imagined self is hurt by an event that causes the imagined self to change.\n\nWhat occurs in this case is \"my imagined future got destroyed by an event that made my imagined future impossible\". Where did this imagined future come from? You just made it up and are attached to it, and now the evidence makes it impossible, so now you are hurt. It is, exactly like a nightmare, your own imagination hurting your own imagination, nothing has actually happened that is harmful. This might sound simple, but it is literally every single thing that ever occurs in our psychological imagination of our past and future. The only time it doesn't occur is when something actually physically dangerous or harmful occurs, in which case you can just respond to it immediately and it doesn't need thought.","timestamp":"2025-04-27T15:32:25.138000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-05-02T15:29:06.728000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1347386199072968705","message_id":"1347386199072968705","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
