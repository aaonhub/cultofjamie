If you were to say to a hologram \"I don't want you to create an image, I want you to just show me what you look like all alone\" it is not possible because that doesn't have existence. What has to be recognized is that all appearances in thought are not the objects they represent, they are all one single object, which is the hologram. The key being that this hologram is literally a sensory faculty like seeing or touching, and not a complex system of past, future, identity, or some ultra-complicated network of ideas.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T07:09:23.101000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1313612816342847498","message_id":"1313646633757573170","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1316662540226400316","channel_id":"1313612816342847498","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I mean ultimately it's like the old \"5 blind monks touching different parts of the elephant\" metaphor. Are the ears the elephant? Are the tusks the elephant? etc. You can tackle the inquiry from any angle you currently think is unresolved in your own mind. Personally I think the most important element to tackle is just what you believe the past and the future is and how it relates to the present. A misunderstanding of our perception and contemplation of time is really the big problem.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T07:06:51.997000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1313612816342847498","message_id":"1313612816342847498","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
