I appreciate your participation and hope that anything we talk about here is helpful. \n\nJust to add to what you're saying and to  give a response to others who might be reading, it is important to recognize your own body not as separate from yourself, but *as* yourself. There is not an operator, there is no operation. \n\nI am not suggesting nor have ever suggested that you are not the body, nor that you are something other than the body. What is the case is the recognition that there is nothing other than *that which is*. \n\nAll of your thoughts are from the body, and all of your sufferings are from the mind.

It isn't the puzzle itself but the pattern of everything unfolding that creates the solution. In the same way I would call intelligence what turns the seed into the tree, it is also what turns baby you into adult you, and what is turning the big bang and the energy of the universe into what it is now and what it will be in the future.","timestamp":"2024-10-12T21:17:04.285000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1293261027395502153","message_id":"1294200089031475241","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":10,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1294037739708219556","channel_id":"1293261027395502153","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"We are the awareness of the sensory information created by the interaction between the organism and the environment: \"the signal\" generated between the two. A dual-view of the same observation is that that you are the human and the being, and a non-dual view is that you are the signal generated between the two. It really makes no difference intellectually but it is very important how your brain identifies with it. \n\n*Conscious awareness and intelligence is itself a function of the organism. It would not occur if the organism was tired, frustrated, high, etc. I would presume these are all beliefs.*\n\nLike you touched on at the end of your first message, conscious awareness is somewhat of an oxymoron as you have no choice but to be aware and it requires no effort or concentration. When people practice concentrative meditation/mindfulness or form beliefs around what awareness is they are doing some activity they have invented that they think will help them, but it's largely not related to self-inquiry or self-realization. \n\nIntelligence if you measure it as IQ or something like that is of course a function of the organism, but intelligence as I'm referring to is more like the innate quality of life that governs behaviour. Intelligence operates the growth of a seed into a tree, it operates how the roots search for water, it is the corrective mechanism that allows life to avoid errors and move towards whatever it is becoming. When you make a mistake, then do something different next time, the subjective change in behaviour is \"intelligence\" and what operates all of our behaviour. In the Tao Te Ching, it itself is \"The Path\" or \"The Way\" and just refers to the root nature of life/reality itself. It isn't something to argue or intellectualize though, just how it appears absent of other beliefs or attachment to explanation. It seems to me it isn't much different than the inverse of physical entropy as a mathemetical concept, as it doesn't really exist as a \"thing\", but as a direction towards perfectly ordered use of energy in the organism. \n\n*I should probably read the bible when it’s convenient.*\n\nWhile I'm sure there is a lot of wisdom and helpful stories in the bible, I would also encourage to think about why you think there are any particular valuable pieces of knowledge in that book compared to any other book. I know this steps on a lot of people's beliefs, but in the context of Christianity at least, it is important to ask \"what did Jesus actually know that caused his insight and difference in state from others?\" it isn't particularly important to read what scholars wrote about him or his ideas/teachings that have been translated in a book. Same with Buddha and Buddhism, they are all just people trying to share the same insight around the nature of the human being that you are, you don't need to stress over the knowledge built around them.","timestamp":"2024-10-10T20:43:59.205000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-10T20:48:34.945000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1293261027395502153","message_id":"1293261027395502153","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
