How that takes place and what exact a-ha moment each person has is different. It is possible to build up a sort of emotional resilience like in stoicism or meditation, but that is just a form of coping or \"mental karate chop\" and doesn't resolve the emotion. It's like being able to treat a wound really effectively or take less damage, but doesn't prevent it from occurring.","timestamp":"2024-11-14T18:15:09.305000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1302272410929598536","message_id":"1302272410929598536","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":45,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
