Not sure exactly when, but it is thematically like \"when does a kid learn religion?\" it is incremental, but it starts whenever they create the belief and it snowballs from there with occasional large or small changes. Your ego/self-image is just \"what I think I am\" so whenever you first invent that is when it starts. Basically it occurs in the same way a belief in Santa occurs, it's just that most people never question or are lead to question that the way they formulate a self-concept might not be correct.","timestamp":"2024-08-12T05:54:08.893000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-08-12T05:54:19.908000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"647791051481939969","username":"blintzknight","avatar":"b76155f2b62f5410f86923bf391e7f15","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1267933030245466144","message_id":"1267933030245466144","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
