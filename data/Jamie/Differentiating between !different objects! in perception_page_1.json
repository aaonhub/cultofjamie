It might not be obvious what the distinction is, so think of it like \"physically painful\" vs \"ugh, don't like that\". A very loud noise or a mosquito's undulating and nagging buzz is \"physically painful\" as in there isn't a reason in thought for it to be annoying, it just fucking sucks. If you look at art in a way that makes you think \"that is a poor job and they don't deserve to be at this level of display\" then that is ego based and emotional. \n\nJarring, loud and acute sounds are things we natural dislike and avoid because they \"hurt\", but listening to music by an artist we don't like is almost always just self-image/ego relating to our own idea of \"bad music\" or something identity related.","timestamp":"2025-01-31T10:07:25.326000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1326165180538687512","message_id":"1329243420622852176","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1328249629061414912","channel_id":"1326165180538687512","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The differentiation between two separate objects that you're hearing is just intelligence acting on the perception of sound, thinking is not usually involved. \n\nWhen you then describe it as two separate things to us, it is now two objects in thought that you have categorized and communicated. \n\nA quick example of this at the extreme is if you are playing bullet chess or doing jiu-jitsu with someone. You will be in a complete flow-state with almost no thoughts the entire time, reacting and doing moves, but then after you can describe dozens of different game-states you were in and how you reacted. You are actively recalling visual experience, categorizing, intellectualizing, and communicating your experience. While you were experiencing it, it was largely without thought, but afterwards you can dredge that visual/touch experience up and analyze it.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T06:29:49.253000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1326165180538687512","message_id":"1326165180538687512","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
