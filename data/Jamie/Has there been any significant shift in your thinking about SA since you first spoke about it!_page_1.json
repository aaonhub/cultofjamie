The underlying phenomenon was a light-switch click and has never changed, but how I communicate and understand various things has and will evolve over time. When I say things like \"you don't experience anxiety or nightmares\" that is absolutely permanent, hasn't changed, and I don't see why it would ever change, but the manner of how I speak about things definitely will/has and hopefully is more particular/accurate over time in order to help others get it too. There are also just aspects like long term relationships or having kids that I just don't know about because I haven't experienced them and I can't currently speak on, so thats another thing as well. When I am 50 I will almost definitely just be talking about the same thing, but in a different way that suits whatever is happening then.","timestamp":"2025-01-31T10:55:36.385000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"188690227987087360","username":"vivimord","avatar":"0acdb90edea6600d6a4ebfdf0778029d","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Vivimord","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1333437271960977540","message_id":"1333437271960977540","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
