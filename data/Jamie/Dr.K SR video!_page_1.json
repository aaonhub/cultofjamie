It's interesting to me because guys like Jordan Peterson will say similar things like \"self-consciousness and neuroticism load almost entirely on the same thing\" and Dr. K has a bit more insight on that because the Hindu and Buddhist religions at least kind of tried to make a \"tier list\" for it. I would personally just say that trying to categorize self-realization in stages, increments, or as a \"method\" is often-times harmful and if it was effective then you'd have to ask yourself why Dr. K himself isn't quite there. I think he's doing an awesome job with everything he's doing and is worth listening to for sure, but I'm fairly confident he thinks he's saying something like \"I'm an advanced lifter, not an expert, but I can help you noobs see why going to the gym is worth it\" which is great, but it's not like that at all. \n\nIf there are specific timestamps I'd be happy to look at those in particular!","timestamp":"2025-01-13T04:30:31.563000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-01-13T04:30:48.497000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"867406560379404329","username":"mrstupid321","avatar":"ba4adb1ce013487687d3271d83e88604","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"MrStupid","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1323041348466507829","message_id":"1323041348466507829","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
