The context being that this whole scenario was unusual or uncommon. I don't experience sadness or happiness when I see this, I just cry. The crying is then automatically seen as \"me expressing this is really an important thing that is being socially signalled to others as socially valuable\". The interesting part is I now cry way more than before, but I'm not actually feeling anything, It's an automatic and purely natural way for the human being to signal \"this is what's important \" that I didn't do before as easily.","timestamp":"2025-08-13T11:37:06.926000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1319751415165489245","message_id":"1402944401499488397","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":28,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1319912707109027840","channel_id":"1319751415165489245","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Still

Basically expressing \"I don't pose a threat to you, please try to understand what I'm saying\" and occurs automatically when another person is unnecessarily hostile towards you. It has no association with anger or any emotion at all and is strictly communicative. With self-image/ego, the reason people get in arguments and then cry as an example is because their own ego/self-image makes them angry at the other person for doing/saying something they perceive as harmful, but then they start crying out of frustration when the other person is angry and misunderstanding back towards them. In a very basic nutshell you never cry out of anger, but cry out of perceiving you are misunderstood. With self-image the feeling of being misunderstood is typically sadness, but without, it only occurs when the other person is themselves wrongly communicating anger.\n\nYou also cry automatically when another person expresses relief/joy or genuine acts of compassion for someone else, like in those videos where someone puts on those colour-blind glasses and sees certain colours for the first time or when a person makes a genuinely compassionate and intelligent sacrifice to help another person. Again there is no underlying relationship to emotion in this case, it is to express appreciation for an act.","timestamp":"2024-12-20T20:37:22.737000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-12-21T06:08:03.438000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1319751415165489245","message_id":"1319751415165489245","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
