Self-realization combined with the physical playing out of your life externally is literally the entirety of what birth to death experience is. To everyone, if you're feeling stuck with self-inquiry, just go do something else, it is still the same thing. When you are acting and living, you are collecting information, and when you are sitting and thinking you are reconstituting and analyzing that information. Sometimes you need more of the former, and sometimes you need more of the latter depending on where you are in your life. When we are dealing with beliefs, it is the case that no new information is ever needed to *not* believe something, but practically, if you are a big believer in Santa at 6 years old, it might be lost on you that a physical being can't travel to 8 billion households in 24 hours and somehow favour the kids with higher parental income, it might be more impactful to sneak out of bed and look at the fireplace at midnight yourself. \n\nWe are all culturally experiencing the late stage elements of the physical part of that, in that almost no one in the world experiences severe physical deprivation or suffering, but cognitive suffering is everywhere. This is the resolution to that, but it's not immediately obvious within our cultural environment. Making money or getting a nice girlfriend/boyfriend is all part of self-inquiry in that it is part of living. My own realization was the result of this effectively being the *last* place I ever looked after a 10 year period of gradual self-improvement and learning. Since I was 12 or 13 I was obsessed with skill acquisition and trying to by successful at individual hobbies in order to make money or a career that would let me feel fulfilled. It was only after some real-life shakeups that caused that whole imagined self-identity to completely crack and when I was about 25 I was like \"this *entire* understanding of myself must be wrong, or my life is completely fucked\" and that led me to look at the \"nonsense\" that was Eastern religion/meditation/spirituality. \n\nTo be clear, 98% of it is complete nonsense, but I was putting up a lot of resistance to even look because my beliefs didn't let me look at something I thought was so non-scientific or religious. Because it's such a good example, it's like getting a republican to go to a drag show or a progressive to watch Fox News or go shooting. They can't bring themselves to do it, not because they actually think they'll be hurt or swayed, but because they are concerned with their own identity being attacked.\n\nLooping around, the main point is that you're not cooked because you've been at it for 2 years, you've been cooking since you were born and continue to do the cooking, so don't worry about \"PhD when?!?\" type of things.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T06:15:46.272000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-01-13T06:21:55.169000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"143575878876528641","username":"gutana","avatar":"fa8e4fc5480896be5798ba6e172cc548","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"gutana","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1326537415879557151","message_id":"1326551455959879700","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":13,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
