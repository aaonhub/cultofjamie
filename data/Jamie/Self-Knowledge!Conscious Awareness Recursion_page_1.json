The recursion in consciousness is really just the belief that thinking is able to take reality, abstract it, and go outside of reality in order to imagine it in a different state that is still simultaneously connected to a past, future, or possible alternative form of reality. The belief that \"reality could be in some way different than exactly how it currently is\" is essentially the entirety of our self-image and invention of psychological time.\n\n2. It is all about emotional relationship to these things. I might want strawberry jam instead of blueberry because it is my preference. I might want a nice girlfriend rather than not having one. It is loneliness that is neurotic and unnecessary and neurotic, and it is anger at getting the wrong jam that is also neurotic. They both are longings or desires for things that are not the case and go back to the belief that reality could/should be different than it is. Completely dropping the \"could be\" and seeing that absolutely, concretely, nothing can be different than its current state is the insight and every moment of your life you have always been in \"my current state\", despite that current state always changing. \n\n3. Yeah I think a lot of SR don't really get what happened to them because they came to it often through spiritual, religious, or unusual circumstances. They usually also are very jargon heavy because they don't usually have a lot of background in other areas, but there's nothing wrong with that I think everyone has their own way of expressing it and other's will find certain approaches more or less helpful. I'd add that I'm not all that familiar with J.K.'s full stance on vegetarianism, the only pieces I've heard are specifically referring to him being a vegetarian and then saying roughly \"from that place, you would never want to hurt another\", and that part is true. The only thing that causes shame is psychologically or physically hurting another and having them communicate that to you and so there is a complete aversion to violence except for protection. I will say though that this does not mean you automatically become a vegetarian. I'm not and a big part of it is that you just care more or less for certain animals. I don't care about killing mosquitoes, but I do care about killing pigs or cows. I also feel worse about killing a cow that has a little cow family vs one that is bred to be eaten and has a decent but short life. Obviously I'd prefer if we could just grow meat like a plant and there was no animal suffering, but even there being a vegetarian doesn't mean conscious life and habitat isn't destroyed in order to provide farmland and produce certain crops. Won't get into that, but I'd say the overarching reason why there isn't a strong aversion to it for me is because I don't see death as a problem for me or any life form, but suffering is.","timestamp":"2024-06-19T21:25:34.235000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-06-19T21:27:37.179000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1253091014516805683","message_id":"1253093017057759394","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1253093492708868238","channel_id":"1253091014516805683","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Our self-image is getting lost in the pieces of the photo like the categories you've drawn and conceptualized","timestamp":"2024-06-19T21:06:10.013000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1253093375477940277","channel_id":"1253091014516805683","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Self-realization in the example you gave is realizing you are the photograph you took and everything in the image are appearances in the photograph.
