I am a human being it seems like. What the fuck is going on? I am experiencing this. I don't know why. I don't *actually* know what the fuck is going on. What even is this existence that I am experiencing? This makes no sense. Alright. Well, I guess I better start with figuring out what this human is and what I am, and then I can start acting in this world\". \n\nWe typically do this as a 2 year old and just run with it because we don't stop to reassess the basis of all experience, which is \"what the fuck am I and what the fuck is going on?\". Just this question without any outside information can be entirely resolved in your own mind. There is no need for external input because the knot of confusion you have created is exactly as deep as your current knowledge and capacity.","timestamp":"2025-04-26T15:25:04.282000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1331153382278172755","message_id":"1363061073686827180","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
