In contrast, self-realization as a phenomenon is the same thing a lot of historical religious figures tried to communicate before getting either killed or put on a pedestal and turned into a belief system. You really just become the completely authentic version of what you naturally are, so the sort of whimsical soft-spoken people fit the mold of guru, and the more forceful types end up with followings/communes/cults/religions. The vast majority of people who are self-realized are likely just very regular people who are like \"well, feel a lot better now, anyway\" and just continue with a very regular life.  \n\nThere's also unfortunately a sort of automatic feedback loop in communication, whereby if you spend a lot of time talking to and cultivating a certain type of audience, you naturally want to lean into their perceived image of you to make them happy.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T07:04:27.554000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1311492547272773653","message_id":"1311492547272773653","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
