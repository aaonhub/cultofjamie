Imagine those scenarios playing out and use it as an example to think *what if I actually did genuinely believe that would happen all the time?*\n\nThere are some people that do, and they don't experience anxiety because of their beliefs, the same way someone with anxiety experiences fear because of their beliefs. It might be helpful to recognize and observe that depending on what you imagine will happen in reality is itself what creates ego based emotional response. This is not an encouragement to \"imagine the best case scenario\" but it is just encouragement to become aware that depending on what you genuinely believe will happen to you is what creates the emotions, and those beliefs are not dependent on fact, but the imagination of the individual.","timestamp":"2024-10-07T05:11:02.957000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-07T05:12:26.511000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1284668299082338336","message_id":"1287664265632940105","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1287534089380954243","channel_id":"1284668299082338336","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It might be helpful to consider that while you can say \"yeah can't directly think about myself\" these are implicitly not the entirety of your beliefs because I imagine other things affect you. For example, if someone you care about insults you, or a person you really like leaves you or dies, this will likely cause emotional distress because your outlook on your life has been harmed. In this situation what has occurred is a change in self-concept that causes us to reconfigure our beliefs and downgrade our psychological model of our lives (self-image). It might be helpful to inquire or examine what *that* is as well as it's all interconnected.","timestamp":"2024-09-22T22:00:48.135000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1284668299082338336","message_id":"1287523282245128328","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1287514998196797511","channel_id":"1284668299082338336","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think the challenge in understanding a lot of views or responses that might arise around the subject intellectually but not necessarily personally is that there might arise a lack of seriousness around some of the less intellectual and more simple sounding parts. \n\nWe can even take it back to your insight you described about life and evolution. The key thing to inquire into is the part where you said \"Everything that didn't continue to try...\" What is trying? How can one organism try and another organism not try? Who or what is making a greater or lesser effort? If you have 10 fish in an aquarium and notice that some seem to be really trying and others aren't, we chalk it up to a little conscious actor or soul inside their body who is making the effort, but is there such a thing? We like to thin we are *making an effort* to achieve or do things in our life, but what is that entity pulling the levers and shifting the gears we call \"me\"?\n\nThere is an implicit assumption you are making about a conscious actor in life that makes a volitional effort to *live* and survive. Nothing wrong with that assumption, it seems correct, but the question of self-inquiry is *what is that actor?* what is conscious experience itself that then seems to do and experience things? \n\nI would also really emphasize that you mentioned that you are able to identify thoughts related to a self-identity and then dismiss them. I would encourage you to try instead to go into each one much much further and try to completely understand what exactly they are threatening or endangering.","timestamp":"2024-09-22T20:44:56.442000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1284668299082338336","message_id":"1284668299082338336","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
