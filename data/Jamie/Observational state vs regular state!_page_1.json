The only thing the monitor is and is aware of is the present signal being pushed through the cable. Consider how it doesn't make any sense for the computer monitor to react to its imagination of a future signal that will get pushed through the cable because the present signal is not harmful. \n\nTo maybe give a bit of something to think about, you might ask yourself \"it makes sense to worry about something bad when it is literally happening right now, and it seems to make sense to worry about something in anticipation of it happening, so when is something too far away in time to worry about, and when is something close enough I should start worrying?\" You will find it very hard to draw this line because there is no line. You will find that anxiety functions as a perfectly intelligent measurement of \"How bad I think something is going to be, how likely it is to occur, and how soon it will occur\" and you will experience anxiety/fear in response to that measurement. \n\nI've been meaning to draw an illustration of this because it's kinda hard to communicate verbally, but what has to be questioned is what is analogous to the \"it burns my hand when I think about burning my hand\". \n\nThe resolution to the time component of fear/anxiety/thought is in seeing that *if it isn't currently happening then it doesn't matter if it's going to happen in 10 minutes or 10 years there is no difference in your actual experience*\n\nIf I were to describe it practically, anxiety is like worrying about \"oh my god, am I going to make this *green* light\". The only time you need to worry about slowing down for a light is when it is yellow because that signals red is about to come and you need to start adjusting your speed. Unless there is practical need for change of function there doesn't need to be any response at all. The only time actual fear needs to occur is when you miss the yellow light and are barrelling through a red light too fast because then fear and adrenaline is necessary to rapidly respond to a physically dangerous environment.","timestamp":"2024-10-10T22:15:26.847000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1266644289182498836","message_id":"1293876971989762142","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":36,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1293108504969609277","channel_id":"1266644289182498836","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"What I think you might get value from is inquiring into what the future and past actually is.

You aren't looking for novelty, which would be something new, you are explicitly looking to understand what is already the case. The current situation is that you are aware that you have constant, uninterrupted conscious experience, you call that \"Me\" but you *also* have many other identifications that you also call \"Me\", which results in emotional relationship to any threats to those things. The inquiry seems straightforward, but when I say it is necessary to take it really seriously I mean you really have to slow down and question some of the things that we usually just gloss over as seemingly obvious. What has to be realized is why/how the second group of identification is a subset of and can be completely folded into the first. You mention that it is intuitively obvious you are one thing, then you say \"couldn't I be xyz?\". This is the entire point. How is it possible that you know you are one thing but also immediately think you could be other things than that? You are not trying to answer this question for me, you should notice \"huh, yeah that is weird\" and then resolve it in your own conscious experience so it's not there\"\n\nFor example you said  \"What I’d really like to ask and receive is the truth about what’s up with me\". You really need to disassemble and look into what you are asking with this question. How would you know the truth about yourself if someone else told you? I could say something and you would be like \"nope, don't think that's it\" or I could something and you'd be like \"Wow, yeah that is so true\". How did you know the first thing was false and the second thing was correct? If I am telling you about yourself the only way you can tell if it's true is by agreeing with it, meaning you already knew the answer. The way you know any answer about yourself is by *checking*. Self-inquiry is not about finding or creating new information or learning from someone else, it is simply *checking* what you yourself are and what you belief yourself to be. When you start doing this you will notice inconsistencies and things that don't make any sense. You can resolve all of these by further *checking* what is true about yourself because you are already the source of the answers.","timestamp":"2024-09-22T23:47:29.521000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1287519486404067359","channel_id":"1266644289182498836","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Your \"life\" as you're describing it is an infinite number of imagined attachments and identifications, but \"Me\" is absolutely one thing and we all intuitively know it is.
