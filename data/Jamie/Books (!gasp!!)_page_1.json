I don't know if this is correct, but a lot of people have talked about the \"Default Mode Network\" being something related to self-realization. You can look into that if you're interested. I haven't looked at it much myself because almost all the subjective tests they do have nothing to do with what self-realization affects (a lot of memory tests and word association, etc.) Probably heard me say it before, but the only reason it resonates somewhat is that the phenomenon is like closing an application on your computer you accidentally launched twice. In that it is a reductive experience not like a new experience you add on. This sort of concept is loosely touched on in the Default Mode Network stuff sometimes I think.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T07:12:58.327000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"710160487886880870","username":"aspectofthenerd","avatar":"b11414cef3de8a52da6aac604c6924a7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ENDER","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1311560142441025578","message_id":"1311560142441025578","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":34,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
