We are getting way too bogged down in \"what technically constitutes the specific quantity of measured time to qualify as the future or past\" when it's completely unnecessary. If you want a more practical corollary, you can say \"would a duck be scared by this or not\". If the answer is yes, then it is physically dangerous, if it isn't, then it's probably anxiety and related to an individual beliefs. \n\nBoth physical fear and anxiety are learned with regard to what objects you are fearful of, in that a baby isn't necessarily afraid of heights or bears, but uses their intelligence to associate concepts of danger with physical pain. Genuine fear is associated with that. This is one structure and it only activates in response to immediate perception of physical danger. It *can* be related to thought, it just so rarely happens that there is a situation that is physically dangerous *and* requires thought to realize it's dangerous that it basically only comes up when people on here invent a hypothetical. A duck would be scared of a bear if it saw it, and so would you. If a duck were kidnapped and suddenly woke up in a dark room, it would just be confused. Humans are intelligent enough that we can respond to thought being applied to immediate scenario to realize we are in a dangerous unfamiliar location and fear would respond to thought in this scenario. In 99.999% of real life scenarios any fear response to thought or dreams is anxiety and related to beliefs and our self-image.\n\nAnxiety is completely different from genuine fear because it isn't associated with the fear of objects that appear in our present environment, but with the fear of objects that appear in our imagination. It *is* subjectively perceived to be the same as being in a room with a bear. But instead of being scared of bears, you are scared of other people and whatever subjective characteristic about them you believe there is threat to you in. This will occur automatically in the way you have described because social anxiety itself is a response to the belief that social interaction poses a danger to us. It is natural to want to object to that by saying \"well, here's *why* it IS dangerous\" and that is already the whole point. If you believe there is danger in social interaction you will be frightened by whatever element in particular you think is threatening to your self-image and who you think you are. If for example you think it is a problem if people don't like you, then you will be frightened to interact with people you don't know because you don't want them to express displeasure in talking to you. If you think it is a problem if a girl/guy doesn't like you, then you are going to be mortified waiting for them to text back. The \"Pavlovian response\" is not a sort of background hum that is conditioned, it is an immediate and very intelligent response to a deeply perceived threat to your imagination of yourself. The moment that self-image or belief collapses it will no longer occur.","timestamp":"2024-10-15T17:04:26.464000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-15T17:05:41.590000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}},{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1294508089864749087","message_id":"1295521784392716319","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1294748239936880660","channel_id":"1294508089864749087","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Good to read your comments after you posted this, hopefully some good insights.\n\n1. You respond to a bear mauling you to death in the same way you respond to looking over or getting close to a dangerous cliff. It is not \"imagining you are getting mauled to death\" or \"imagining you are falling through the air\" it is an automatic response to sight, sound and sometimes thought being applied to immediate sensory experience. It isn't lying in bed, perfectly safe, and then getting anxious when you imagine something that might go wrong in your life, it literally \"I am right now literally in a physically dangerous scenario\". \n\n2. You're misunderstanding what I mean when I'm saying there is no past and future, in that what you are describing is *not* the future. What you are calling the future (but isn't) is the present thought \"I am going to be hungry later\" that has semantic meaning and leads to action, but is just an idea you have right now. There is no \"future\" in it. Then you presently drive to the store, then you presently buy the groceries, then you presently cook the food and eat it. There is no experience of the past or future in any of this. What I'm pointing to is that there is absolutely no experience of the past or future, yet we call \"eating dinner later\" the future despite it not being the case, it is again just some words you are thinking right now. There is no experience of anything ever at any time other than present experience. This isn't a \"well technically\" argument, it is immensely important because we psychologically believe \"buying groceries later\" *is the future* which creates a parallel problem in our life that doesn't exist. If you only ever respond to present experience, it will resolve all \"future\" problems, but by reacting to present experience and an invented \"future\" we distort our behaviour by reacting to two \"realities\" simultaneously. \n\n3. This is the same thing: \"How much weight I can bench press\" is just knowledge that you have, it isn't any different than \"How much can the other guy bench press\". The difference is if someone insults \"my\" bench press it hurts our feelings, but if they insult someone else's bench press we don't care. It is the identification with \"this knowledge is about *me*\" that falsley creates attachment and emotional response. They are both just thoughts in our mind created from sensory experience and aren't different. It's like if I were to write \"15x15\" on a piece of paper and someone said \"225\", then you said \"oh, that's my bench press!\" and someone else is like \"no, it's math problem\". The reality is it's the number 225 being mistaken for \"self-knowledge\" that symbolizes a characteristic about ourself when it really is an identification we have mistaken for ourselves.","timestamp":"2024-10-12T19:47:15.660000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1294508089864749087","message_id":"1294508089864749087","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
