Have to move from where I am June 30th. Have thought about doing a sort of \"travel and work\" type of thing, but we'll see what ends up happening. I'm honestly probably just moving to Vancouver and that will be fun, so a bit sporadic right now getting things in order, but have to kinda resolve that. \n\nI guess I can answer \"belief\" very straightforwardly in that when I usually use the word I make this distinction in my own mind despite never really clarifying it (sorry pals). To be brief, every time I use the word \"belief\" in this server I am aware that people think:\n\nbelief: the emotional attachment to an idea. \n       \nbelief: an opinion.           \n\nIf I were to distinguish between them, which I don't (my bad), then I would say that the former would be capital B Belief, and the latter would be lower case b belief\n\nI again never do this personally because I only use the former, but I would say:\n\n(B)elief: the emotional attachment to an idea. \n\n(b)elief: an opinion. \n\nI might make this distinction of (B)elief and (b)elief in future writing or a book because they are distinct and really important, and if people are not sure about it then it would be helpful for me to clarify. Up until this point and still ongoing, I don't use capital B, but every time I say \"belief\" I mean the former. I am always referring to an emotional attachment to an idea. If I mean \"an idea\" or \"a thought\" I just say \"here's my opinion\" and will not use the word belief.","timestamp":"2025-03-19T07:21:59.941000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-03-19T07:50:00.672000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1314037954729218089","message_id":"1351757926183993356","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1351749756308688946","channel_id":"1314037954729218089","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I don't think it's going to be super practical but I'll start making some new content on the mental health channel in the next few months as i've finally got the equipment I want and am moving, but I think I just want to make the stuff that I want to make and we'll see how a definitions thing fits into it","timestamp":"2025-03-19T02:50:56.200000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1314037954729218089","message_id":"1346337586461016086","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1351749497197432953","channel_id":"1314037954729218089","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"No lol","timestamp":"2025-03-19T02:49:54.423000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1314037954729218089","message_id":"1346337586461016086","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1328231043806789652","channel_id":"1314037954729218089","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"No lol -
