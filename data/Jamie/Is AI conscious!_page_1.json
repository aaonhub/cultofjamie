Yeah what we're discussing here is more of an objective sort of \"opinion\" or judgment, I don't really tie in my perspective on this stuff to self-realization very much and don't see it as super related, just what I think about technology, AI, etc. \n\nThe main point around \"so why couldn't a computer be conscious if the signal analogy is true? Couldn't it be possible?\" Sure, there are elements there, but our own consciousness does appear to \"do something\" that is a separate function from simply \"displaying what is occurring\". In that using the computer analogy, I would say that the human body's brain and sensory faculties are the computer and the monitor, and the \"signal\" is what we refer to as \"Me\", which is the subjective entity that is aware of the computation taking place by the machinery. In the case of a computer, there is no observable or self-declaring entity that takes the role as a \"signal\" in that relationship. This is just an opinion, but it seems that consciousness is a physical and biological function of the brain that seems to have some role that is akin to prioritizing relevant information or like the \"conductor\" of the orchestra that directs attention and awareness of certain parts of the brain towards other parts of the brain. This is experienced as \"will\" or a feeling of autonomy. It is also recognized in other animals as \"how similar it is to me\". In that we are pretty sure a dolphin or dog is conscious because they seem to intelligently respond to changes in information like we do, but we are more dubious of things like a fish, mushroom or plant. I don't actually know if this is the case or not and I don't think anyone does either, but I am suggesting this function is not necessary in computers or silicon based architecture as it currently exists because there is no need for \"will\" or uncertainty. Everything is computed as 0 or 1 and all events are rounded to those values, so there is no need for \"intelligence\" or nuance. That is to say I think you could create a \"conscious\" computer, but the ones we currently have are not. My view is that the question of \"oh shit is it concious?\" will emerge when you have multisensory machines that need some sort of executive function to co-ordinate them all with appropriate \"intelligence\" or priority, and that's when consciousness imitating or genuine consciousness might emerge or we will have more objective insight. \n\n2. Right, I also don't think an LLM lacks intelligence in terms of capacity, they are usually better at most humans at art, language, or programming as an example, but they don't perceive and are not conscious in my view. I am saying that AI's can simulate natural intelligence using computation, but the sub-components of all computation is just yes/no, on/off, 1/0. Even if there is naturally induced randomness like measuring radioactive decay to produce a number, that isn't the machine itself inducing randomness, it takes a random value, and then computes it precisely. My only view on AI currently is that it doesn't appear to me intuitively to be remotely conscious because there is no process in its operation that isn't linear and related to a single task. I imagine when it gets more complex the debate will be much more confusing and less certain. \n\n3. Yes, this is an opinion question there isn't really much related to self-realization I'm mostly just yapping.","timestamp":"2025-05-02T15:01:51.981000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1361909035993141381","message_id":"1366401243270090773","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1366068586510028841","channel_id":"1361909035993141381","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Current AI in my view is categorically not conscious. At a \"well can it be though?\" perspective the main argument in my view is that AI is silicon based and ourselves are carbon based. It seems from my understanding (not great) is that our brains compute using restrained probability distributions, while computers that use silicon always collapse those same electrical distributions to yes/no which is 0/1. \n\nThis isn't a very high level view, but if all probabilistic computations are forced to collapse to binary outcomes, there is no need for consciousness, while you can intuit that if our brains operate somewhat probabilistically, the intuition we need \"intelligence\" or \"will\" comes into the fray as a possible explanation for what consciousness is.\n\nI think we will get necessary insight when we start putting silicon chips into our own brains and augment our own experiences artificially, and see where our own consciousness ends and where it begins a bit more. I don't fundamentally know at all.","timestamp":"2025-04-27T15:08:51.351000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1361909035993141381","message_id":"1361909035993141381","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
