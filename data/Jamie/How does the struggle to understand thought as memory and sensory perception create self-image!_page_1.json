You weren't \"there to perceive it\" and also \"I am here now, remembering it\", they are exactly the same thing. The false belief is they are separate entities as \"past me\" and \"present me\", when the only thing you have ever experienced is \"what I'm experiencing right now\" which covers all experience.","timestamp":"2025-05-02T15:03:51.034000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1355931644313342144","message_id":"1367219596100239372","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":13,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1366060002913026121","channel_id":"1355931644313342144","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You learned the number 1 before you learned the number 100, and you likely learned the number 100 before you learned the number 10,000. You also probably learned the number 10,000 before you learned that X or Y can be used to represent a variable that could be any number. Do you perceive numbers as having duration or \"order of invention/memory?\". \n\nJust like anyone, if someone said \"what did you do last year?\" I could be like \"I went on a trip to Europe\" and if they said \"what happened when you were 5?\" I could say I moved from Canada to Australia as a kid. There isn't loss of order of events in that regard, there is just the recognition that this is my current memory and how it is structured. I am currently in Japan visiting family with my Mum and she has brought up some stories of things I've done or said that she remembers me doing as a child and I don't remember them at all. It's all a consequence of the present structure and memory of the individuals brain/memory, not an intrinsic observation or characteristic of past reality.","timestamp":"2025-04-27T14:34:44.862000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1355931644313342144","message_id":"1361712122991476836","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1359709924640293115","channel_id":"1355931644313342144","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The recursion is caused because we invent a self-concept we call \"Me\" in order to have continuity with past experience. Because something had previously been experienced by our senses and that information was stored, we infer because we experienced it that there is a \"Me\" that existed in the past that observed said phenomena. This entity exists in thought as self-knowledge (our ego/self-image). \n\nIn order to access and modify this concept we have to think about it. This means \"Me\" is thinking about \"Me\". We believe there is a \"Me\" which is the entity doing the thinking, but we also believe there is an object we are thinking about that is allegedly also \"Me\". \n\nBecause thinking is so abstract and complex, and the only tool we have to analyze the sensory perception of thought is itself thought, we get lost in it and cannot see its actual nature as a sense that occurs now and exists only now just like all the others. There is no fictional \"Me\" that had previous experience. Your memories are exactly that, they aren't things an imaginary \"Me\" has previously experienced. They are components of your present self. \n\nWhen you use any of your senses except thinking they all exist only in the present moment when you are experiencing them. When you see something it is always \"Now\", when you hear something it is always \"Now\". This is the same for all senses except thought. We know that thinking occurs now, but believe can be \"about\" the past or future or other objects. This is because thinking is created through the intelligent manipulation of memory, which is previously experienced sensory perception of all the other senses. This creates the illusion of past memory, duration and time in our thoughts that does not actually exist other than as present experience. \n\nAn example of how this can be observed without self-realization is when someone tells you a sad story of their childhood, it might cause you to get sad, cry, and long for the lost past as well. If this person told you the same story in Japanese, you would not interpret it abstractly with thought, you would it interpret it only with your ears as sound. If they said it in English you would say \"my god they were talking about the beautiful and lost past\" but in Japanese you are like \"they were just making some sounds in the present idk\".","timestamp":"2025-04-10T02:01:48.223000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1355931644313342144","message_id":"1355931644313342144","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
