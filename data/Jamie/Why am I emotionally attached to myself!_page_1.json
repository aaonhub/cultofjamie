This is caused by the root misunderstanding that your actual existence exists in thought. \n\nIf we are twin siblings and we both did something bad, I might get anxious because I believe Mom will punish us. You might feel fine because you believe that Mom will find it funny and it's no big deal. Neither of us can predict the future, but we are emotionally dependent upon our imagination, which are our beliefs. \n\nThe underlying realization is a deeper analysis of why this occurs, and the subsequent realization that all analysis or judgment of ourselves that is contingent upon thought/imagination is unnecessary and only harmful.  It is seeing that \"Me\" cannot be imagined or affect by thought or our perception of time/past/future.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T05:15:18.417000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1324784465347612794","message_id":"1324784465347612794","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
