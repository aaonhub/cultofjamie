For example, if you are sad most people think \"I am having a sad thought\" as in there is a \"Me\" that is just chilling, then there is \"sad thought\" thrown at them by their biology that they can't control, and then they're like \"damn, this keeps happening, how do I deal with sad thoughts?\". \n\nWhat eventually occurs is a completely integration that causes you to realize why sad thoughts have occurred, that they don't \"happen to you\" they itself are part of you, and then they will completely stop occurring. \n\nIf your strong suit isn't with words or with this approach, then I'd recommend looking at other speakers or meditative approaches perhaps. You can use any resource, we are all trying to triangulate around the same central point, so all compasses point north so to speak. The root question is just \"You exist, what is that?\" Not as in \"oh, so am I actually God, or like in a video game??\" which is literally \"stuff that you imagine might have caused you to exist\", but simply \"No, you know you exist and refer to yourself as 'Me'\" What *specifically* is that entity.","timestamp":"2024-11-13T18:26:59.602000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"551768653402734592","username":"greyandout","avatar":"dc8918ab5cbf0cfbbfd2c3a90f40a018","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"GreyWorm","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"492371812722802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HG","badge":"f44e81e3643194067e800245c2377a89"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"492371812722802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HG","badge":"f44e81e3643194067e800245c2377a89"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1301729765157244948","message_id":"1301729765157244948","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
