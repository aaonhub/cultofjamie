I just want to know what the fuck *is* me and my experience\"\n\nKnowing what *is* that we already are curious about and want to know is self-realization.","timestamp":"2025-05-24T07:28:19.021000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1371914634038218803","message_id":"1371914634038218803","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
