If someone says \"you are really ugly\" or someone says \"you're one of the dumbest people I've ever met\" either of these might hurt our feelings, why? Because we believe we are a nearly infinite number of identifications with appearance or intelligence and are attached to them because we believe they are us. \n\nWe say \"my intelligence is part of me\" and \"my appearance is a part of me\". Examine the contradiction with this emotional relationship and the view that \"I am what I currently experience\". We believe we are constant ongoing experience in the present, we also believe we are an object of thought called \"Me\" that is tall, short, rich, poor, smart, dumb, moral, immoral, funny, unfunny, successful, unsuccessful, and emotionally react to those identifications.","timestamp":"2024-07-11T02:49:34.669000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"880303042153562172","username":"mando3305","avatar":"28c91456ff1394b736aa5b8e9f23f05d","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Sebastian","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1260464383310565406","message_id":"1260464383310565406","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
