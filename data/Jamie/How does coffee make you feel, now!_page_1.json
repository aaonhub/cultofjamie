Physical experience is still the same. \n\nCaffeine gives basically no high but makes it hard to fall asleep. Alcohol gives no change in feeling, but makes me chatty and uninhibited. Psychedelics give shortened emotional highs but the same physical experience. Cannabis is like caffeine or alcohol and is largely just the physical effects. I use to feel there was some sort of advantage to drugs before, but now it is mostly a weak tradeoff but sometimes fun or useful.","timestamp":"2025-05-26T12:53:28.887000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1374926651317555300","message_id":"1375774331480838244","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1375741726488268840","channel_id":"1374926651317555300","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah I don't experience coffee anxiety anymore, but there is absolutely a heightened energetic and \"responsive\" experience. \n\nI used to experience a several hour \"high\" when I had coffee that also coincided with heightened anxiety, so it was a tradeoff for me in that way. When I drink coffee now it's massively shortened in terms of \"high\" experience (like 15 minutes) other than being unable to fall asleep which I've always experienced. \n\nI don't experience anxiety at all, but there is still a sort of \"same biology, extra energy and inappropriate attention\" type of thing that makes me not able to socialize or communicate comfortably. For clarity, there is still an enjoyment of \"yeah I like drinking coffee\" even if the positive effect is super minor. \n\nReciprocally, it is similar with alcohol. I used to think alcohol was like \"this drug makes me not anxious and so I can now be an uninhibited and elevated version of myself!\", but that's not true, you actually are a more \"loose\" version of yourself but have less access to medium and long term memory that genuinely does enhance short term function, but inhibits medium and long term decision making.","timestamp":"2025-05-24T07:46:27.640000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1374926651317555300","message_id":"1374926651317555300","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
