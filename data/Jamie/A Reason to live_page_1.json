You specifically need a reason in thought to not live or do anything different. It's like saying \"why don't you get social anxiety?\". It's a backwards understanding because not having social anxiety is the default, you need a reason to be frightened of social interaction. \n\nFor me personally it's the same as asking why any animal does what it does or a plant grows into itself. You don't really have a choice, it's the natural progression/unfolding of the organism to turn into and do what it is. This is seen pretty clearly if there isn't an imagined \"Me\" who we think is making all the decisions and building our life, as it's really all just the physical animal/creature doing it all, including doing the thinking. This is much more obvious when you look at anyone else except yourself, because they always seem to act \"in character\" and do things in a patterned way. It is obvious to us that other people always acts in accordance to their natural personality, but not to each individual because they believe an invented \"I\" is doing it.","timestamp":"2024-12-20T20:41:16.643000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-12-20T20:44:09.832000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1319038822968983682","message_id":"1319038822968983682","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
