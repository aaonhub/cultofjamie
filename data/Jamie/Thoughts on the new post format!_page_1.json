My two cents so far:\n\nPros: \n- Easily identifiable topics for people to look at\n- Way less clutter\n- Other people adding their perspectives when relevant is easier and less intrusive\nCons:\n- I am mostly manually going through each one to see responses or follow-up questions because I can't easily track new notifications. I am sure someone is going to tell me how I should be doing this lol, but so far the \"yeah I'm just gonna reply to like 10 people back to back in a list\" is an easier thing to do but obviously not scalable, although going back to see past posts is also not either. \n\nWhat I'm sort of seeing is that this format is a lot like the kind of Q&A you get in a live seminar format, where it might be hard to keep up with past posts, but you can just make a new post to be right at the front. The idea being that any question I can hopefully respond to, but followups are hard to keep up with beyond \"hey just following up from your response an hour ago\" and so its still in the same feed. Again, thoughts on the format and any suggestions?","timestamp":"2024-07-02T08:44:37.280000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-02T08:45:27.557000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"}]
