What is actually you is exactly what is currently caught in the rake, which isn't from the past or going somewhere in the future, it is all \"right here, right now, caught in the rake\". \n\nIt can be helpful to consider that 99% of the things you have experienced you have forgot and that 99% of the rocks the rake has touched are gone. Anything retained is only because it has relevance or attachment to the present circumstance.","timestamp":"2025-04-27T15:12:55.171000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"867406560379404329","username":"mrstupid321","avatar":"ba4adb1ce013487687d3271d83e88604","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"MrStupid","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1362029854626676836","message_id":"1362029854626676836","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
