This might be helpful.\n\n >*“i am fundamentally inadequate and lacking”*\n\nThis some form of ambition, which is the belief our current life is insufficient for someone or others to love us. Again, the specifics are dependent entirely on your life and beliefs, but the emotional outcome is the discomfort with inaction and dislike of yourself, demanding constant change to objective superlative comparison to our current state or others. Might be money, might be fame, might be attractiveness, age, weight, strength, intelligence, etc. \n\nSpeaking only on the idea side of it, not the self-realization side, the reason this belief is harmful is because other than the true \"you can't change the current reality\", the issue is that ambition doesn't come from the desire for greater achievement, it stems from the present belief you are insufficient. A more accurate viewpoint of what an ambitious person is trying to realize is that they aren't actually inferior or insufficient, it's that they deeply desire elite lifestyles or romances. It's not the \"I am so lame\" it is \"I want this extremely superlative life\".\n\n*I think this also relates very closely to a sense of loneliness.*\n\nThis is a similar thing. Loneliness is not the feeling of isolation, it is the desire for meaningful companionship and is centered around the belief of what we think we deserve or desire as friends. If you believe that you should be friends with Albert Einstein and Sydney Sweeney, you will likely be lonely your entire life because your beliefs are in error and causing ambition. If you believe you are a loser and no one will ever like you so you never socialize, you will feel depressed and would ask yourself what's the point at all? The reality is you will be friends with other people are similar to you in your current place in life and you each provide value to each other, and there is social relationship. It's not rocket surgery, but the actual solution psychologically is having no beliefs and just interacting with people how you wish to interact and reacting intelligently, and whatever happens happens, but barring this it is realizing there is no loneliness, there is only the belief you don't have the relationship you think you should have.","timestamp":"2025-12-07T11:21:27.079000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1428677755909701702","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":153,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
