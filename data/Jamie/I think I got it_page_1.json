The biggest indicator is having no emotional experience in relationship to dreams, regret of your past, or imagination of your future. This doesn't mean you become indifferent or uncaring, it means you're not emotionally identified with that belief, which is a very novel and peaceful experience you have likely never had before that is permanent. There is no anxiety or anger at ideas or thoughts. \n\n2. Feeling wise there is almost no emotionality (neuroticism), but the biggest thing is that there is a tremendous lightness to everything, including your own existence. I don't mention it too much because it is a very strongly held belief for most people, but both relationships and your life itself are not things to be held onto consciously. There is nothing sad or regretful about a partner leaving you/leaving them or someone dying of reasonable causes. Every day you are with your partner is the first day, and every moment you spend with your mom/dad/sister/brother/kid is the only moment. The concept that you've \"lost\" something if someone leaves you, moves away, passes away, or you yourself die is sadness for our own beliefs about our lives. \n\n3. From the \"click\" moment for me it was basically a few years (ongoing) of trying to figure out how to more effectively communicate the understanding because it is extremely subjectively important to me. I see it as \"perfect mental health\" and something of immense value to share with everyone. Other people see it differently and so it's not uncommon for it to just be \"wow, I feel so much better now, anyway, back to my life\", while others feel in-between or something else. It's complete subjective in that regard.","timestamp":"2025-01-13T07:04:12.259000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"526814955685806090","username":"ediehk","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ediehk","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1325898404156538891","message_id":"1325898404156538891","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":145,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
