I never have nightmares unless I'm super drunk or impaired somehow, and even then something bad might happen in a dream but there is no emotion. That relationship doesn't occur.\n\nIt is absolutely the case that your brain and body do a lot of things that *you* are not consciously aware of or understand, such as existing in the first place and experiencing anything at all, but emotional relationship to imagination and dreams can all end and it is in the category of what you're describing. You experience extremely scary observational phenomena in dreams or hallucination because your brain is trying to process emotions and produces observable stimulus in consciousness as a knock-on effect. It is in my view what explains people's belief they are God on psychedelics because they experience genuine love for the first time, and the knock on effect of that is annihilating their beliefs and and causing them to perceive they are faultless and their life is perfect, which is their belief they are God. You actually just are experiencing love, but love necessitates nothing contradicting your ego and life being perfect. In contrast when I take psychedelics now I don't feel like I'm God, I just feel love to a much more muted degree (no relief), and sort of dream while I'm awake.","timestamp":"2025-12-07T11:41:14.957000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1443858372012150888","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1447187770379341936","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Sorry guys I'm blasting into my @'s.\n\n> How do i go about not believing i need to be successful?

In the last 30 years western millennials have really promulgated Materialism as the dominant philosophical belief along with the growth of science to counter religious fundamentalism, but recently there's also been a counter culture trend towards Idealism and Neo-creationism (like simulation theory) as well. \n\nSelf realization is not an argument, it is a physiological event that mildly alters your perceptual experience. It is the end goal of talk-therapy (although they don't know it) and the end goal of meditation (usually the same story there), it is not related to philosophy or theories of everything. Any time I talk about how things are perceived or whatever it is strictly my opinion from my own perspective. \n\nAn example would be that I would never claim that there is \"no external reality\" what I would say is that the notion of external reality is misunderstood by the people using it. An example is that our earth and universe is obviously considered \"external reality\", but when someone has a dream they are in Antarctica in 1850 as an explorer, this is also considered a different \"external reality\" while it is happening, but is then retroactively downgraded to an \"internal reality\" or imaginary upon waking up and realizing it was just a dream. This is not internally consistent and I might hope that someone sees that and says \"huh, it does seem internally inconsistent, I must figure out why it appears that way to me\" which would be doing self-inquiry. I similarly have a problem with Idealism because if everything is mental construct or product of mind, what is that?

The more straightforward answer is that I just feel compelled to share my perspective and experience because I do.

Being able to model, analyze, and project a future outcome from observed information in your life into an optimal \"future\" is just a function of thought/memory and is useful and what we all pursue. I put quotes around \"future\" because the shift in perspective is connected with no longer perceiving a \"future\" that you're creating, but awareness that you have created a model of the present that may occur after a series of actions or probable outcomes. \n\nThe difference is that it is only necessary for this to operate on external objects. It's the difference between a bird saying \"I want to make the most optimal nest so I can attract a cute female bird\" vs. \"I feel insufficient without the perfect nest\" or \"I will be happy when I get the female bird\" or \"maybe I can't make the ideal nest like the other birds\". Psychologically, the difference is that our self-image invents imaginary \"anchors\" that exist as past events and future events that we are currently in-between with regards to time. This does not actually exist and is a misperception of how thinking operates. \n\nMetaphorically it's like the man sitting on a donkey with a fishing rod attached to a carrot out in front. The donkey keeps walking towards the carrot because it perceives it as an object that is in front of it that it is moving towards. When you zoom out it is actually an object that is attached to itself and moves wherever it moves. Thinking works the same way but our self-image does not realize this to be the case.","timestamp":"2025-04-09T23:09:43.232000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1358995786951557150","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1359664178050236619","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The part about imagination that we all get intuitively is that sometimes what we imagine will happen doesn't, and we think \"what was I worried about?\". This causes us to later experience anxiety and think \"calm down, it's just your imagination it probably won't even be that bad!\". \n\nThe observation is not that our imagination might not be correct, but in this imagination of our future lives, there are various possible outcomes that we believe are uncertain. What can be seen is that our anxiety is directly proportional to the probability of something bad happening to our imagined self and how bad that thing would be. This is all determined subjectively, instantly, and is a function of intelligence you can't control. \n\nThe part that we struggle with is that in order to cope with our anxiety, we try to figure out coping mechanisms or rationalizations of our assessment of future possible suffering in order to feel better now. We say things like \"well, if I embarrass myself it means I'll have more to learn from for next time!\" or \"It doesn't matter how awkward I am when I ask her out, she's already made up her mind if she likes me or not!\". \n\nWe think we are discovering something new about our situation, but we are actually moving backwards from an instantly experienced state of intelligence/belief/anxiety functioning simultaneously and we are *analyzing that* to come up with coping mechanisms or new beliefs. This never accomplishes anything because it's taking a problem, accepting it, and then trying to internally reconfigure it. \n\nThe resolution is not in trying to deal with the problem in thought, or to doubt your conviction in the first place, but to question the entire premise in the first place. You experience social anxiety because you anticipate that something bad might happen to you and you are worried about it. What *actually* is the \"Me\" that gets afflicted when you are socially rejected or embarrass yourself? If you start looking at it this will you will see that if you get socially embarrassed or rejected, there is absolutely no physical harm to yourself, what actually gets harmed is what you think about yourself. The reason we experience anxiety is because it is our current belief about ourself that a negative event will cause us to change our beliefs about ourself. Seeing this allows us to realize that \"the plane never lands\" and that all neuroticism is caused by our beliefs about ourself being threatened by beliefs about ourself, but there is never any harm in any actual real event.","timestamp":"2025-04-09T23:00:01.386000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1356381039349727453","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1336636672686948443","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Thanks for the quote, was my own words","timestamp":"2025-02-05T09:56:56.277000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-02-05T09:57:50.048000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"328673677094682632","username":"hhwea","avatar":"e2b6daf30526bc4f6cc9fa7ba0e81ea5","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"hannah","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_f2267c3ad99c109859d15a592d7afe24","sku_id":"1458472704435945653","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1382845914192023632","asset":"nameplates/nameplates_v3/aurora/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_VOL_3_AURORA_A11Y","palette":"teal"}},"display_name_styles":{"font_id":8,"effect_id":1,"colors":[]},"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1336629675052503060","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1336627635572314112","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@import_pickle Just to clarify, I think the document you are referring to is one that Hannah made and updates, it's not necessarily directly my own views unless referenced, but is a useful resource/compilation for people to look at. \n\nThe straightforward answer is that you have your primary senses like seeing, hearing, touching, etc. that we all know occurs to us right now this instant. Thinking also operates this way, but because thinking is composed of our memory of previously experienced sights/sounds/touches, we mistake the sense itself for an entity we then call \"the past\" or \"the future\" when it is really a very simple and plain sense that occurs in the present like our seeing or hearing. \n\nSelf-realization is ultimately about realizing all sensory experience occurs and exists only \"Now\" and there is nothing else that we can or are ever aware of other than that. \n\nThe recursion that is likely being mentioned is that we have an entity in thought we call \"Me\" that occupies our whole lives most of the time. When we remember the past, it is \"Me\", when we imagine the future, it is \"Me\" in the future. These are both thought. There is also an entity we call \"Me\" who is the thinker of the thought who exists right now. So now we have \"Me\" who exists now doing the thinking, we have \"Me\" in the past who did something, and we have \"Me\" in the future that I will one day be. All of these entities we have emotional relationship to because we think it is us.

But yeah I still experience frustration occasionally in circumstances like \"oh fuck I forgot to save the entire document I just wrote\" but there isn't anger. I haven't yet experienced it on stream at all but I'm sure it could happen. Again it's part of the reason I think self-realization is pretty hard to notice unless you spend a lot of time with someone, because if anything I'm more emotive than before but it is entirely for social/entertainment purposes.\n\nIf it's helpful at all, I think a misconception a lot of people have around meditation etc. is that the goal is to block out all the thoughts, when the real purpose is to realize why thoughts don't actually have any negative impact in themselves. If you extend the analogy the perception that a self-realized person always appears extremely calm is not true at all, it's that they are always internally completely calm regardless of how they are communicating/thinking/dreaming. \n\nIt's likely the case that guys like Eckhart Tolle have become so popular because they are legitimately talking about SR, but they are also just naturally calm and soft-spoken people, which fits the image that everyone looks for in a guru and so people think \"well, if anyone is enlightened, it seems to be *that guy*\" when in reality self-realization just allows you to be completely authentically yourself with no inhibition or insecurity.","timestamp":"2024-12-27T03:23:29.793000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"276007111337705472","username":"qldisc","avatar":"7661094b263126cc79c9c68cc4799660","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Tik","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1321465053358194720","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1321460577549418598","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@pikachu_is_boss @qldisc haha yeah it's worth getting used to it if you watch the streams.

There isn't anger or frustration at all, I just like \"complaining\" or engaging with chat that way. I don't think I'd ever experience anger playing a game now, but would say that frustration is possible. I haven't experienced it in any streams recently though.

It contains the emotion. Stress is pretty vague and varies situation to situation, but usually contains mild anxiety (It would be bad if I f'cked up this project), mild anger (someone else unfairly worsened my situation), but primarily it is a heightened level of what I guess you'd call \"alarm\" or \"alertness\" which is the sort of \"butterflies in your stomach\" from an adrenal response.  \n\nI think the closest thing to describing generalized stress is \"uncertainty and demand for action\". At a very low level it is akin to boredom, at a moderate level it is alertness or impatience, and at an acute, heightened level it is alarm. \n\nTo just share my own experience, stress as it's conventionally described no longer occurs, but you do still feel a sort of \"incongruence\" that needs righting that's similar to seeing something slightly out of place. If for example you said you were going to call someone that day but forgot until 8pm, suddenly there will be a pang of \"oh shit\" and an energetic signal drawing you towards action. Similarly, alarm is also still experienced and signals \"look over here\" or \"do something right now really fast\" and is essentially the adrenal \"fight or flight response\". This only occurs in sort of instantaneous and sharp pangs in response to an immediate change in circumstance.","timestamp":"2024-12-17T08:05:35.957000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"721388489115172924","username":"river_rafter","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"riverrafter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1318340297138114652","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1316689834588508160","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Not sure if you're asking for a reply to that message or something else, but I think I get what the guy means, although it seems to be a pretty unique little piece of the puzzle to him. The only thing I really gather that's interesting is part of the realization that your fundamental identity is the current sensory experience you are aware of (you literally *are* the sense perception). In the case of thought, when you hear a bird chirping, there is instantaneous awareness of not only the sound, but the direction it is coming from, the proximity to you, and what type of bird it is. All of this is the simultaneous amalgamation of your sense perceptions and the knowledge of them you have previously accumulated acting in unison. This is part of what I usually refer to as \"intelligence\" but it's sort of the central operation that we experience as \"Me\" and happens automatically. \n\nIt might be in this guy's case that it's kinda like the old story of a monk who was pursuing self-realization, and only when he had super bad indigestion and had to let it all out in an alley by the street and embarrass himself did it all kinda \"click\". Probably a made up story, but a lot of people in the sort of meditative traditional camp seem to figure it out when they have some small experience that causes them to basically drop the \"it's a mystical lofty experience\" and engage with something very immediate and practical, could be the case with that guy idk.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T08:55:19.480000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1316673417138798612","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1316687839530057739","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I'd throw in that it's actually not a huge leap in terms of external effectiveness to get to self-realization. What your brain is doing with your ego/self-image/self-knowledge is basically trying to create a picture perfect replica of everything you experience in order to try to accurately model your life with knowledge. The realization itself is essentially \"Oh, by only interacting with present experience, which includes thinking, I actually interact with and resolve the past and the future simultaneously and don't need to model it\". It's just a matter of realizing \"oh, once you count to 10, you don't need to remember the previous 9 numbers because the number 10 means there was 9 numbers before it, and the next number is 11, it's embedded in the information already\". It's just a perfectly efficient way of interpreting reality without excess and unnecessary information. \n\nIt's pretty likely there is a lot of evolutionary pressure for self-realization, but it's only really hitting hard around now when the pressure has shifted from \"have as many kids as possible to fill all this space and work on the farm\" to \"people will very selectively reproduce only with socially compatible long term partners\" as a result of reaching a population limit, cost of living in cities, and an intellectual age economy. Even in large civilization, there is always organized religion or strong political beliefs, and one of the reasons from an evolutionary perspective has been because it essentially creates a large, homogeneous belief system that reduces the conflict between individuals. Essentially you co-operate and don't experience as much anxiety/anger if everyone believes and acts with the same beliefs.","timestamp":"2024-12-12T08:47:23.821000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"180866243819995136","username":"creikey","avatar":"7ea3ef410568c63dcdc7bf4a3305e9bb","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"creikey","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1316612919747940402","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1316684766535225357","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah I think Hannah can set that up if it's not already.

If you have this emotional relationship with another person it makes no sense to want to have a sexual relationship with anyone else.

beliefs.","timestamp":"2024-09-20T18:12:13.268000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"210575654524026880","username":"dimefox.","avatar":"11af762583dd387f7fcdc219e76efbf2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"dime","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1283068363005755412","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1262341827487469568","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"we're

Realizing a literal night time dream is a dream causes you to not be emotional attached to it, but how that might happen for each person is different. The thematic difference is usually when people get there through the sort of more common guided meditation type thing its because at a certain point you sort of just see the *fact* of how you experience reality, in that you directly observe what the \"Me\" is directly, whereas what I describe is more about seeing that your self-image is false, and when it's seen to fundamentally not exist at all, it vanishes, leaving you in your natural state. They're still both the same thing and two sides of the same coin, just different methods. When most people talk about \"Me\" they are referring to two things, but don't realize it. Self-realization causes you to only experience and recognize the \"Real Me\" but if you get there by realizing \"oh, this is the real me, so everything else isn't\" or \"this thing I thought was me wasn't\" then it doesn't really matter which way you come at. \n\nAn interesting method that misses the mark for obvious reasons, but really helps people who are religious and is a insightful concept to play with is completely absolving yourself from personal responsibility by saying \"I am relinquishing all expectations of what my life will be, I'm leaving it up to God\". This actually makes some sense because it actually does erode part of your self-image which has expectations and beliefs about the past and future, but obviously the belief there is a God who is coming up with your life plan is also a distortion. The part that is actually accurate though is having beliefs about what your life was, how it will be, and taking personal responsibility for how all of that turns out is our self-image and causes us a huge amount of strife. The belief \"Everything has happened because it's how it was supposed to and everything will happen because its destiny\" is missing the mark of \"Everything is exactly how it is and there isn't anything else\" but it's also a better effort to negate the past and accept the future than our usual effort to constantly try to \"fix\" our lives. Sometimes this route of absolving yourself of all personality responsibility is called the \"Faith\" path because it essentially can negate the need for our self-image to some degree, but is pretty out of fashion and easy to be led astray for obvious reasons.","timestamp":"2024-07-05T04:17:32.809000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1258624413222567956","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1258632011141218354","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah the reason it is challenging is because it's not an intellectual concept and can't be converted into one other than metaphor. Self-realization is exactly what you are describing, you have to figure it out yourself because what you are figuring out is yourself. Literally. You are yourself and that is what you are trying to understand. We aren't trying to figure out \"my characteristics\" we are pointing directly to existence and saying \"I exist, what is it that *exists*\".\n\nThe realization example I gave around the camping gear is more to give the scope of what it feels like to have a \"realization\".

Most people have so much trouble with self-realization because they inacurately imagining what it is and then chase something that doesn't exist. Like if I say \"what is existence?\" people instantly think they are supposed to figure out \"why is there existence?\" or \"where did it come from?\" or \"here are its characteristics\"  When the question is actually meant as extremely literal, \"You are existing right now and just need to check\". The problem is that because we always use thought like a hammer, we naturally look for nails. Even when what is meant to be communicated is \"nono, don't look for a nail, look at the hammer and understand what it is\" the person then says \"got it, I will look for nails that look like hammers\" and again its like \"noooo\"","timestamp":"2024-07-05T03:54:15.708000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"180866243819995136","username":"creikey","avatar":"7ea3ef410568c63dcdc7bf4a3305e9bb","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"creikey","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1258610819986493512","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1258627952346791988","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Subjectivism is a belief, in that you hold up an image in your mind of what you think life is and say \"yeah that's what I think life is\". You are looking at the object of thought and saying \"that object in thought is an abstraction of my experience\". This is not related to self-realization because it still involves a misunderstanding of how thought operates and isn't addressing the direct experience of what \"Me\" is but an intellectualization of it. For example, we can go back to saying \"What I am is the subjective awareness of sensory perception\" and then someone else can say \"Yeah that's what I am too\". The misunderstanding is that clearly two people are not the same thing, I see out of my eyes and you see out of yours, but what we are calling ourselves is the recognition of ourself in the symbol, which is our self-image. \n\nJust to address your particular situation in relationship to this, not to be too insensitive I'm sure it's very stressful hahaha, but just for the sake self-inquiry,  the anxiety you're experiencing is caused by the belief that something bad might happen in the future and you are responding to your imagination of those events to try to reduce their likelihood or mitigate them. We naturally think this makes sense because the things we are imagining might happen and so we should be prepared, but what is unnecessary isn't thinking about what might happen in your life, the error that causes distortion is the misunderstanding of what your imagining that causes us to experience fear towards something that explicitly does not exist. \n\nIt's not that you can't accurately imagine the future, it's that the future does not exist, so you can't imagine it. What you are imagining is not the future, it is an image being created in thought in the present. Self realization results in a change in emotional state because it's not an intellectual observation of \"yeah yeah, my imagination of the future isn't necessarily the future\" it is the *actual* observation there is no future because everything only happens in the present. When the future arrives it will be \"Now\" and so you don't need to be concerned about worrying about it in imagination, because by dealing only with the present you will always be resolving the future when it arrives. Ten years ago you were \"Me, now\", today you are \"Me, now\" and in ten years you will be \"Me, now\", there isn't anything else. It's a bit like observing that if the only way to count is by going \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" then there is absolutely no reason to ever worry about missing a number or if you're ever going to arrive at a certain number in the future because there's only one way you can count, and when you see how that counting itself works, you realize you will automatically cover every single number in the process.","timestamp":"2024-07-05T03:38:08.016000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-05T04:20:25.488000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1135121138545066095","username":"itsneekeetah","avatar":"f42f13524c5220149866d9b953093a7e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"itsneekeetah","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1258609681119842387","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1258608249658413117","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah exactly the belief you are creating pointers is our self-image and the cause of psychological suffering.

When he refers to the realization that objects are mental creations, this is true in same way a subjectivist would point out that the entire universe is particles/fields/energy and what appears to be objects and their characteristics are really just sensory phenomenon created by the brain, but the actual experience of non-duality/self-realization is related to seeing that when you conceptualize an object, such as \"my dog\" there is an automatic belief that the thing you are imagining is a pointer to a real object.\n\nIf you imagine your dog is at home right now and is eating your new shoes, you might suddenly get angry, because what you think you are imagining is a possible interaction of real objects. In essence, what you believe you are doing is \"thinking about reality\" and then responding to those abstractions, but what is actually happening is you are thinking *in* reality. It isn't at all possible to encapsulate reality within thought and then reconfigure it because thinking is always a subset of reality and takes place within it. It might seem like a clever little trick or shorthand for seeing \"ur thoughts aren't real bro\", but if you look at it really closely, you will notice that we simultaneously can observe that yes, thinking must occur as a subset of present state reality, but it *also* seems to be the case that we can abstract reality and imagine it in other possible states and react to that as well. Seeing that the latter is actually not true at all reveals that not only can you not turn reality into an abstract object of thought, you also can't turn anything into an object of thought either. Essentially that thinking operates like the creation of a hologram, but the hologram itself is the only real thing, the abstract representations it creates are *never* real. That realization results in the cessation of perceiving objects in thought (whether that is \"Me\" or any other imagined object) and results in seeing that  there is only one thing that exists and that we are part of, which is \"the awareness of reality in its present state\" and there is nothing else that can be perceived and no need to be concerned with anything else.","timestamp":"2024-07-05T01:57:23.410000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1258486119712948317","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1257975977087205406","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"What do you guys think about 1pm PST? or would later in the evening be better for most people?","timestamp":"2024-07-03T08:27:25.001000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1257974803873267754","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Maybe we can do the 15th?

The learning process/development that led to the realization was in hindsight like untangling a knot or like they say in Zen/Buddhism it was like using a thorn to remove another thorn and those things for me were all thought. \n\nI think while we often point to the sort of objective being in some way perceiving that all experience can be subsumed and perceived only instantly and right now, and all you have to do is sort of \"wake up\" or \"see\" that fact, it wasn't the way that I really got there despite that being definitely the most obvious or \"direct\" approach.  \n\nOne of the major pieces that got me to reformulate my self-concept to a point that it allowed me to really begin to understand what was meant by anyone talking about this stuff was the realization that while it felt like I am the entity coming up with and directing my thoughts, kind of like how you move your hand intentionally, the actual thoughts that I'm capable of thinking are limited to whatever the current biological and physical structure Jamie the Human's brain is currently configured to. I want the things I want and I think the things I think and I like the things I like because it's baked into the present condition of the organism and whatever I experienced 10 years ago was exactly the same phenomenon, and whatever I experience in ten years will be the result of what that organism's present state will be in ten years. 18 year old me had completely different concerns and thoughts than I do now, and I will also have completely different thoughts and interests in ten years. I do not have control over these they will be the result of how my biology interprets, understands, and learns from experiences I have. In essence, there is no control because the machinery producing thoughts are no different than your physical fingers or the leaves on a tree. At a certain age the roots come out, then sprout, then the leaves, then the trunk grows, then one day it fruits or reproduces and all experience is a function of the present physical function of that organism or life form. \n\nFor me that realization made me take something like personality and instantly see \"oh, I don't create my own personality, I uncover and develop whatever it already is into whatever it is able to become\". Metaphorically it feels like \"hatching\" your personality and then meeting its demands for experience to let it become what it is. You don't ever need to consciously cultivate a personality because you can't. You can only become more of yourself. This led me to the insight I've talked about before that caused a lot of my ambition and insecurity to drop away, which was \"oh, it's like a video game, you can just do whatever you want\". That was just a piece that resolved a harmful but significant belief I had, but at a deeper level that same angle can eventually resolve itself into self-realization that allows the deeper understanding that your entire life, from birth to death, isn't like a video game where you can freely do whatever you want, it's like a video game where everything appears to be letting you do whatever you want, but that's only because all the options outside of your natural development cannot be conceived. \n\nUsual long post, but tying it back in, I think for people who are sort of diving in the deep end on this stuff, if I were to say \"Yeah your life is an open world rail-shooter\" or when we say \"can you know your existence without thought or concepts?\" it's a bit like \"I'm sorry what\" to a lot of people, but the real meat of everything is \"Right now, your life and experience seems incredibly complex, difficult, and unresolvable by thought. It is actually extraordinarily simple and can be untangled\".","timestamp":"2024-07-02T06:53:05.781000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1257176907984670843","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1253102237941629010","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's all about seeing that there is nothing but the absolute fact of present experience and reality is nothing else than exactly its current state. There is absolutely no continuity other than the belief \"what if things were different?\" things cannot be different than what they currently are, things could not be different than they currently are, and any thought about alternative states of reality are just images appearing in reality's current state. \n\nIt sounds like a gimmick, but look at an analogue clock or open a video of one. Watch the second hand and notice that no matter where it moves, the time you experience is always \"now\". Ten minutes will pass and it is still now. Ten years will pass it will still be now. Every single moment it is always \"now\" because there is only moment. Your whole lift has passed from beginning until now, and will continue until death experienced as \"now\". You will never, ever psychologically experience the future and you have never psychologically experienced the past. Any conceptualization of your life that you believe has existed in the past or will exist in the future is a misunderstanding of the present, as you have never experienced anything other than that.

The way the sensory perception of thought operates has been misunderstood since we were children and needs to be re-examined to see what it is and how it works before being used to solve problems.","timestamp":"2024-06-17T10:40:28.393000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"180866243819995136","username":"creikey","avatar":"7ea3ef410568c63dcdc7bf4a3305e9bb","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"creikey","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1252208807967195197","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1252210124077010975","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Generally speaking your natural sense of fear will be in proportion to how dangerous something is which is a combination of the magnitude of the threat and the probability of it occurring. Your ego-based sense of anxiety will vary based on the same thing but according to an underlying belief there is a certain type of danger. \n\nI think it's difficult to start using a lot of hypotheticals because the hypotheticals themselves are reactions to beliefs. I'm not really sure how you're evaluating how you would feel in these situations other than extrapoloation from similar circumstances or reacting to how you feel when you think them, but for me at least they are so particular I don't really have a clue. The only thing for sure is they are all physically dangerous situations and so I would probably feel some sense of fear but that's pretty much it. Other than trying to solve a problem or escape there wouldn't be any thinking going on about life regrets or my future being thrown away or dissapointing anyone for example, it would just be \"wtf do I do here?\" and I'd be pretty scared probably","timestamp":"2024-06-17T10:35:58.519000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-06-17T10:36:39.065000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1252207085580456026","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1252208347005063219","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The reason feeling anxiety over something that you think will happen to you is irrational is because you can't imagine yourself.

Repeat this for a few dozen or hundred generations and over time it becomes full of tradition, ritual, community, belief, and basically eventually it just becomes a *lifestyle* that certain people are attracted to. This is largely what Eastern Religion is, and what even going to Church is in the West, along with spiritualism, meditation and yoga. \n\nLike what Capy said, the actual elusiveness of SR is that the structure of ego is that of past and future, and so part of our motivation becomes \"what will become of me *later*\". This belief allows us to look at people doing something utterly nonsensical and invent an imaginary outcome that justifies the irrational behaviour. We also further cement our beliefs by saying \"Well, look how much better I am than *before*\". Just to be clear, I'm not saying it can't be smart to look at something unintuitive and say \"maybe?\" and then try to figure it out, but that in order to do so as effectively as possible there needs to be the absence of coming at anything with the emotional attitude of \"I already know\" or \"I don't want to be wrong\" which creates distortion and resistance to finding out. \n\nWith regards to imitating SR'd people, I see it as analogous to the ten commandments or the noble eightfold path, in that the miscommunication is that non SR'd people automatically assume that what is being communicated is basically *greater knowledge*. This means that instead of interpreting what a speaker might mean, which is \"If you are able to use your human intelligence clearly, without previous conclusion, then you will see this clear as day. You seem to like the sound of what I'm saying, so isn't that a compelling reason to inquire into your own experience to find out why or if it is or isn't so?\" they instead interpret it as \"I trust your judgment, and will act according to your better knowledge\". \n\nWhich to be perfectly honest, seems to make a lot of sense. When J.K. says something like \"The speaker has been thinking on this his whole life, over 60 years. It isn't a simple thing, but very serious\" basically everyone is like \"Oh ok, well you seem pretty fucking smart and I heard you're like a enlightened mystic or something so can you just give me the answer already so I can act according to that?\"","timestamp":"2024-06-17T09:15:26.664000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-06-17T09:19:50.042000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1252173530305658891","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1251732236315791432","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's important to recognize you don't need to make an effort to try not to think about your past or future, it's just what's going to happen automatically when you get to the root of the misunderstanding. \n\nThe reason you are concerned with your imagination of the past and future is because you think what you are imagining is not real, but the objects they point to are real. For example, you likely are very aware that when you imagine getting rejected by your crush, that imagination is not \"real\", but it still makes you feel sad or anxious because you believe that the girl/boy in the imagination is a real object with real thought and this imagination might truly happen and right now you are just contemplating this outcome. What you are worried about is a bit like a bad weather report, where you see that in 5 days, a really bad storm is going to come and wreck your house. Sure, maybe it might miss, but there's a good chance you're fricked, and so you look at that weather report and feel upset and stressed. This is how our self-image operates and affects our emotions.\n\nThe misunderstanding is not that projecting an image of what you think might happen to you might not be helpful, I still do that, we all still do that, the difference is that there is absolutely no emotional relationship to the imagination of past or future because there is a separate realization that *even if* you were 100% guaranteed to experience what you imagined it is still completely unecessary to emotionally react to it because you can just react to it when it happens instead. Again, if *why* this makes sense is completely understood it happens automatically, you don't need to fight yourself. \n\nTen years ago you were \"Me, Now\", right now you are \"Me, Now\", and in ten years you will be \"Me, Now\". There is no moment in your life when you haven't been \"Me, Now\" and so the only thing you ever need to react to is exactly what is occurring to you right now and that will always \"cover all the bases\". \n\nReally it's a little bit like realizing that you don't ever need to worry about the mountain, you just need to worry about where to place your foot next, and that will automatically cause you to climb the whole mountain in 100% of circumstances and in fact your physical experience will still be exactly the same, just absent of worrying thoughts and distorted actions according to those thoughts.","timestamp":"2024-06-16T02:57:01.198000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-06-16T02:58:35.964000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"589819099090255894","username":"cyu3281","avatar":"adeb6222dd06ae9c5fefa05b91054d97","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Steam","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1251714564320395306","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1250297350912475178","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"just critique his stock portfolio lmao","timestamp":"2024-06-12T03:55:17.859000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1250297329110487050","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"if I were coached by hikaru that would be sick af","timestamp":"2024-06-12T03:55:12.661000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1250297294692159498","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah I will say I would love to do one of those influencer chess things","timestamp":"2024-06-12T03:55:04.455000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1250297167944482908","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah appreciate the question, know you're just joshing and I swear I can lighten up, but I do definitely get bored, but I don't \"feel\" bored if that makes any sense. Just another lack of appropriate language that's not particularly helpful. In the past when I've experienced boredom, there was an emotional/adrenal component which is basically uncertainty with no positive or negative emotion paired with it. If you experience an ego based positive expectation + uncertainty we call that excitement, and a negative expectation + uncertainty we call it anxiety. If you experience just *uncertainty* which is the sort of adrenal response of \"butterflies in my stomach\", at mild levels that is boredom, moderate levels it is impatience, and high levels it is urgency. If there isn't the emotional/adrenal component, you still have a sort of intellectual \"ugliness\" to things and are not attracted to them. That's what I mean by bored with my old sort of content. I see it as a bit dated and I'm ready and wanting to make a new thing. \n\nAnyway, actually the last time I streamed starcraft that's exactly what I did I'm not sure if you're referencing this but SC2 also has Grandmaster as the highest level rank lol. Came back in Legacy of the Void and made it a goal to hit GM. Literally got to rank 200 exactly and then peaced out lol. But honestly was pretty unsure about what I was doing and didn't appreciate the value of the stream back then. Hoping I can try again and foster a similar sort of little community again. Chess is also super cool I was pretty inspired by Tyler1 getting to like 1950 by just suicide grinding puzzles and rapid games 12 hours a day lmao.

I'll give a short life update, this isn't meant as a heavy reply straight to you, just thought I'd share with everyone. Latest interesting news is I'm going to start streaming again and maybe make that my main focus work wise. Hope you guys like Starcraft lol. You can simul-stream on both Twitch and YouTube now so financially it's much more viable, and I was sort of thinking that I could really make that my main focus rather than my usual casually explained content that I'm a bit bored with. Think it's a good way to fill my time while interacting with people and eventually opening doors to communicate this stuff to other people. I think I can then weave in this type of content, the new sort of creative comedy travel series I want to make, and all that stuff with a bit of a live sounding board to sort of built it all up with back and forth. \n\nBeen thinking a lot lately about my overall sort of physical life situation and have been realizing that pretty much all my friends are getting locked into the sort of late 20's career and building a relationship/life grindset. I remember sort of thinking like 5 or 6 years ago that I wanted to move to a bigger city to have more peers, but I loved hanging out with my friends and hosting people at my place and doing that kind of stuff, and thought \"yeah I'll move when everyone else moves/leaves\" sort of anticipating people would go away after university or do other things. Pandemic happened and some of my friends are here, some have left, but their lives are much more focused on jobs and partnerships and it's sort of the same thing. What I've kinda realized, along with what I talk about here, is that the intuition around \"I'll leave when the homies have their own life to live and aren't here anymore\" was correct. But at the time I sort of saw it as \"I got pretty fortunate with my career, have a place and good income, and have a lot of fun hanging with everyone and partying etc. so I'm really content doing what I'm doing here for a while\", but it turns out the actual foundation is \"My personal motivation is dictated by how I can use my resources/attention to help the people I interact with\". Now that everyone is sort of living a different lifestyle, I sort of see my role as less significant, and so there's naturally a sort of feeling of \"ok well time for my act II I guess\", and a huge part of that is having other people to respond to and interact with, and so I thought streaming is probably the best way right now to sort of broadcast myself. No idea how it's gonna go and don't plan on doing anything on there super intentionally, but will just sort of roll with it and see what happens.","timestamp":"2024-06-12T02:50:33.210000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"721388489115172924","username":"river_rafter","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"riverrafter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1250257219761602631","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1250234851068608513","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah like others said it's because most young people kinda view a particular god like they view santa claus. They hear the claim that there is a particular entity with certain characteristics that has certain powers, then they look for evidence if that's the case. They invent an object in their mind called \"God\" it has certain characteristics, they then look for proof of that object, see none, and additionally believe counterfactuals to many of the alleged acts of that God (age of the earth, evolution, etc.) and basically just say yeah this ain't it chief. The difference is that religious belief is essentially a form of knowledge, and you combat it with other knowledge and essentially collect and replace blocks of knowledge as you build your understanding of the world. The imaginary object in thought that gives you presents is Santa, and that \"slot\" is replaced by your parents. The imaginary object called \"God\" that created the universe is replaced with the big bang or another theory. Moral commandments might get replaced with philosophies or life advice. The reason the object of thought called \"Me\" is so hard to eliminate is because \"Me\" *does* exist. It literally is what we are. We have direct proof that there is a \"Me\" literally all the time every instant of our life. Naturally we then turn that \"Me\" into an object of thought with certain characteristics and think about it. Self-realization is the result of seeing that you actually are not capable of doing this. The actual entity you call \"Me\" is always doing the action, it can't be *in* the action. It's not about being convinced, like in an argument or belief, it's about seeing for a fact what actually is the only thing you can really be 100% about and no one else can, which is \"you exist right?

The question always leads back to what outcome you actually want. The question is then \"is this outcome my self-image or what I actually want?\" and if you have a self-image it will be very unclear because both are what you think are true, but the hint is that if you feel an emotion while making a decision, there is ego involved somehow. The clue always for good decision making is \"do I feel emotionally involved with this behaviour?\" if yes, then self-image/ego is doing something and you are making a slight error whether you know it or not. Again, it is not like \"oh shit you fucked up your life\", it's more like \"I knowingly did something I didn't want to do in hindsight\". \n\nTo give a small example, compare the idea of taking someone on a nice date because you are hoping to impress them and they will feel obliged to come home with you vs. taking someone on a nice date because you have the means and would like them to enjoy something they might not otherwise have experienced. The difficulty isn't that you have a hint of the former and a hint of the latter, it's that you have both. Why do you have both? Why do you have two goals? This is caused by the split emotional drive of ego/self-image vs natural intelligence acting out its preference, which is compassion.","timestamp":"2024-03-22T02:43:33.687000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1220559636416041030","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1220561330088448111","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"hmmm no, I'll check it out that sounds interesting for sure","timestamp":"2024-03-22T02:34:58.026000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1135121138545066095","username":"itsneekeetah","avatar":"f42f13524c5220149866d9b953093a7e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"itsneekeetah","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1220559158521364620","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1220558617581981761","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"super smart too","timestamp":"2024-03-22T02:24:11.314000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1220558606982975588","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"definitely a top tier comedian so that's for sure","timestamp":"2024-03-22T02:24:08.787000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1220558572404867072","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"hmmm.

The belief there is an origin other than where the camera is creates our ego. Essentially the belief there is a camera or 3d plane upon which anything arises, like consciousness, is also our ego, as it is an imagination of a \"receiver of input\" from sensory experience and that \"I am the receiver\". What must be examined and understood is that you are not \"Trent, experiencing the world\" you are \"The experience of Trent, part of the world\" and what that mechanically entails that is different.\n\nWhen J.K. refers to the fact there is \"no centre\" he means centre of thought *within thought*as a train of ideas, not where it physically feels like it is coming from as someone like Ramana might insinuate and get a bit ethereal about. For example, if you say to your crush \"hey, want to go out with me?\" and she says \"oh god no\", then most people are sad. The reason most people are sad is because they think \"she hurt my feelings\". Why? The reason is because we think \"I mean, it's one thing to say no, but she really made me feel like I'm worthless\". What is actually occurring is not the surface level conversation of \"I feel bad because she rejected me\", it is the feeling of worthlessness around the actual centre which is *I* was rejected in a way that implies *I* am not attractive and *I* have been hurt. What is that *I* at the centre? That's the meaning of the examination, not to look for where physically emotions or thoughts arise from, because there isn't a point where that occurs.","timestamp":"2024-02-22T09:27:03.503000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1210121424878968852","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1202900052297781308","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Hey sorry, not super up to date with the general chat but am here now!\n\nWhat you referenced previously is the same as when J.K. or other speakers refers to \"the observer is the observed\" or \"the thinker is the thought\".

The irony comes from the fact that if you said \"yeah, self-realization is just being at permanent peace and contentment and natural relationship to what is happening\", someone who doesn't understand could say \"well, that is the first step, but then there is permanent bliss and union with the universe\" and you're like \"uh, ok sort of, but do you experience that?\", \"well no, but I believe my mentor has done it and so I think it is true\".

It seems he generally meant \"the plane upon which experience takes place\" in the same way that no matter what you ever do you are always located \"here\" and experience \"now\". But he has also used it to mean a physical location in the body, but apparently only for certain people who insisted on associating themselves with their own body. \n\n\"Question: In that case, how can it be localised in any part of the body? Fixing a place for the Heart would imply setting physiological limitations to that which is beyond space and time.\n\nBhagavan: That is right. But the person who puts the question about the position of the Heart considers himself as existing with or in the body. While putting the question now, would you say that your body alone is here but you are speaking from somewhere else? No, you accept your bodily existence. It is from this point of view that any reference to a physical body comes to be made. Truly speaking, pure consciousness is indivisible, it is without parts. It has no form and shape, no ‘within’ and ‘without’. There is no ‘right’ or ‘left’ for it. Pure consciousness, which is the Heart, includes all, and nothing is outside or apart from it. That is the ultimate truth. From this absolute standpoint, the Heart, Self or consciousness can have no particular place assigned to it in the physical body. What is the reason? The body is itself a mere projection of the mind, and the mind is but a poor reflection of the radiant Heart. How can that, in which everything is contained, be itself confined as a tiny part within the physical body which is but an infinitesimal, phenomenal manifestation of the one reality? But people do not understand this. They cannot help thinking in terms of the physical body and the world. For instance, you say, ‘I have come to this ashram all the way from my country beyond the Himalayas’. But that is not the truth. Where is ‘coming’ or ‘going’ or any movement whatever, for the one, all-pervading spirit which you really are? You are where you have always been. It is your body that moved or was conveyed from place to place till it reached this ashram. This is the simple truth, but to a person who considers himself a subject living in an objective world, it appears as something altogether visionary! It is by coming down to the level of ordinary understanding that a place is assigned to the Heart in the physical body.\"","timestamp":"2023-12-07T06:41:34.060000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-07T06:52:55.888000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1182149231495086090","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1182207350413721650","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@foo_ohfgf yeah I'd mostly agree I'd just also throw in that when we say \"self-improvement\" we really mean things like making more money, becoming more attractive, improving our skills or knowledge, or being more attentive to things we've been neglecting.

If you think \"I am currently like this, but I would like to be more like this\", that is just using thinking for what it's for, which is using logic and memory to create the most efficient plan of action to do the things you want to do. The mistake in \"self-improvement\" as a genre is that it's usually driven by ambition, which is the belief you are currently lacking and emotionally attached to an ideal you want to pursue. The classics are \"I'll rest when I'm a millionaire\" or \"I'll get a girlfriend when I'm jacked and well dressed\". Genuine self-improvement is completely natural because it is just what you want to do when you do the things you want to. If I like rock-climbing, making jokes, getting in shape, and cooking, then if I keep doing those things I like, I will constantly encounter problems and opportunities to help others, and I will genuinely be excited and happy to learn more about them and improve my abilities. Take the stuff we talk about here. I enjoy responding to people's questions and try to figure out better ways to communicate what I'm talking about and so I know that compared to myself 6 months ago I can do a better job. The way that self-improvement is seen differently is essentially that human beings are analogous to plants, and just like how a seed automatically grows into a certain type of plant, you are doing exactly the same. It doesn't matter who you try to imitate or rules you make for yourself, you will always end up exactly acting out your own nature no matter what. That doesn't mean the outcomes are written in stone, it just means you plant an apple seed you get an apple tree, but that apple tree is still unique among any other apple tree. \n\nI'd just say this as well, it's not that I have no self-concept in the way you're wondering about it, what I'm saying is that we both have a \"self-concept\" the difference is that you think it is you, and I think it is just a \"concept\" with no relationship to the self. This is the reason there is emotional relationship to self-imagination, because there is the belief what we are imagining is ourself, when it actually isn't.","timestamp":"2023-12-07T06:24:36.626000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"324809219792437248","username":"foo_ohfgf","avatar":"84daa0c23030283fb265a2ddf03ed91a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"OnPoint","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1182003601489547336","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1182203496498483280","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I guess I'd say maybe to spend a bit more time on the time element. I think it's easy to basically be like \"yeah yeah everything occurs now that's all there is ok\". But that's not the point at all. If you actually get the time component you'll get the whole thing. The problem isn't that we need to believe \"reality is ever-present and occurs only now\", what we *also* believe is that we can recall past moments in time and imagine future moments in time. This entire structure is our self-image. In a very serious way, the fundamental realization is that time does not actually exist in your experience at all. An actual good meditation that comes off as goofy but is actually the most profound is to look at a clock and say what the time is. Every time you say \"4:13...4:14....4:15\" what you are doing is expressing human measurement of the cycle of the earth's rotation that creates day and night. If you instead use yourself as the subjective reference point, the time is always \"Now\". A clock could simply display the time \"Now\" and it would never be wrong, because that's the only time you have ever experienced. \n\nThe \"Me\" is literally timeless because it only experiences exactly what is currently occurring. The reason the question of \"I exist, what is that?\" is asked is because we believe we are two things, which is \"Me, Now\" and \"Me, in my imagination in the past and future\". The realization is identifying the underlying source of all our thought and abstractions in sensory perception in the first place that causes these two \"Me's\" to collapse into one. When I say, for example that you \"can't think about the past or the future\" it's very natural to be like \"oh, what he means is that you're thinking about tomorrow, but that thought is not literally tomorrow, it's just your imagination of what it will be like\" and no, I am literally say that itself is false. You cannot imagine the past or the future not because it has already happened or because it hasn't happened yet, you can't imagine it because it doesn't ever exist. It never occurs.","timestamp":"2023-12-07T06:14:37.844000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1137147889123074099","username":"anakinslywalker","avatar":"811743dcca2958cab6aa21b1a1675786","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Fillmore","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1181977875742736424","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1182199989968048168","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I'll take a peep at the first episode and see how it goes","timestamp":"2023-12-07T06:00:41.822000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"89826366870007808","username":"jorge2096","avatar":"bbe4f176c3dfef23476b09336d14dc17","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jorge","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1181947143930511402","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1181883480745967646","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Haven't seen it but have heard good things.

I would again use the analogy of religion because it is exactly the same. Any point of view around self-image and belief systems that cause our conventional mental illness are identical to the beliefs systems around religion, but the subject is just different. Instead of having emotional relationship to social rules dictated by a certain book and clergy, we have rules around political beliefs and social norms, we have beliefs about our family and friends, we have certain beliefs about our own lives and what we are meant to be to feel valuable and effective in society. They are all absolutely identical in that our attachment to ALL social norms and emotional relationship to them are belief driven. \n\nMy personal view if you want to take an evolutionary biologist's lens is that there are two pieces: take for example right now, having beliefs are actually a viable and helpful mating strategy for most people. You are quite literally, more attractive to certain people for holding certain beliefs, which encourages reproduction. Not a complaint, but whenever I meet anyone, they have beliefs, and so if they say \"I believe this, do you agree?\", it is clearly less attractive to say \"No\" to literally anything they believe that isn't just \"an opinion\". The other view is fundamentally that human beings have intelligently evolved beyond all other creatures in terms of language and knowledge, but we haven't yet got to the point of seeing exactly what reality is and so suffer from both the drawbacks and benefits of our ability to think. \n\nI sort of think about \"thinking\" as a video game buff that's like \"you do 2x damage but take 30% more damage\". Compared to the rest of the animal kingdom that is an insane buff, but not perfect.

He was absolutely clearly self-realized, like without a shadow of a doubt, but his communication was always at \"level 10\". Unless it would hurt someone's feelings and he'd tone it down, he was just like \"yeah this is how I see everything\". From my own perspective, he is absolutely correct on nearly everything that he really means and communicates, but partially limited by knowledge of his time and defnitely by translations. When he describe the world as Braman or \"satcitananda\" like in Buddhism or Hinduism, he doens't mean the religion, he means what the religion is based on, which is \"Consciousness, Reality/God, Bliss\" which is poorly translated because it really means \"Me, the world, happiness\", but no one would ever translate it that way becuase they don't feel confident enough to interpret the meaning. Instead we all criticize \"waht is consciousness? What is Reality? What is God? What is Bliss?\" when the whole meaning has been completely lost.

You might say \"well, I thought I would get a certain result by a certain time (belief) but I haven't yet.

This is incredibly, insanely distorted by self-image, but if someone breaks up with you even though you still love them, you will feel sad, and that sadness means \"pull away from this interaction\". Extreme sadness, when not related to self-image, has an extremely interesting meaning but not one I'll bring up now because it can be misinterpreted really badly. \n\nWhen sadness is experienced in relationship to self-image it is much more broad, and is simply \"my beliefs about who I am have been diminished\" which is extremely wide reaching and encompasses a ton of things depending on the person. In my view, the reason dogs for example express sadness towards their owners passing is for exactly the same reason we genuinely experience sadness, which is perceiving in communication that love is no longer something we can experience. I think it's probably complicated for dogs because most of them are not really smart enough to comprehend death right when it happens, so they probably go through a period of not being sure if their owner is just temporarily gone or like actually never coming back etc., which means they would also experience fear and uncertainty rather than straight up sadness right away. It would be interesting to see how a Border Collie reacts to their owner passing vs like a less intelligent dog.","timestamp":"2023-12-03T02:35:07.728000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-03T02:36:56.497000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180591000289296394","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180694990050033684","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just to endorse this I've watched all of these episodes and think this is a great interview series.

I think it might have been J.K. who said this but roughly \"When you cry at someone's death, you aren't crying for them, you are crying for yourself. You aren't sad for what they've lost, you're sad for what you've lost\". This is extremely true. While again I can't say I've personally experienced it as no one I've ever really cared for has passed away, my intuition and best assessment kind of running the scenarios in my head would be that my personal emotional reaction would be entirely based on how the other person was communicating to me as they were dying. As in if my dad was in hospital and about to die and seemed frightened and scared, I would feel fucking awful for him. If he was like \"yo buddy, had a great ride, thanks for being a part of it, see you on the other side\" there wouldn't be any shred of sadness it would actually be quite touching and make me feel good. I again can't say for sure because I don't know what I would feel if I really loved someone romantically and they were like hit by a bus or something, but I'm pretty confident that any mourning or sadness I'd experience would be mostly in relationship to what the other person was communicating because that's the only cause for emotional experience for me currently. \n\nAs a bit of a sidenote, life, death and the whole experience we have as human beings really becomes viewed as a bit of dream sequence. Like if you don't have emotional relationship to beliefs or a self-image, then the idea of people being born, people dying, making money, being successful, all sorts things we usually view as really weighty are not seen that way at all. It really is like a \"stepping-back\" and you just kind of think \"lol, I guess I'm human doing human things. No fucking idea why but off I go\". It isn't literally knowing this because we can't, but it's emotionally analogous to realizing that everything we experience is just a video game or simulation. You yourself have almost no investment because you know it's just a video game, but you have deep investment in other people because they don't realize that and take everything really, really fucking seriously.","timestamp":"2023-12-03T02:14:23.339000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-03T02:18:09.455000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180566579591790622","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180687160920260658","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"This is interesting and I like this part. \n\nThe only thing I'd say is I know with absolute certainty that no matter what I'm thinking about right now it's just thinking, and the \"type of thinking\" doesn't exist, there's just thinking. I'm very confident nearly all the stuff showing up on brain-imaging is related to emotional processing, that emotional processing then causes an automatic response to \"deal with that emotion\" which likely engages novel problem solving thought. I think it is likely the hippocampus is engaged in relationship to passed loved ones because that invokes feelings of despair, which is hopelessness. We experience that in relationship to our self-image as \"I have lost something I can't get back\" or \"my life is in disrepair\". This means there's always a future component to it. What is unique about that example compared to the others listed is that fires, sexual assaults, school shootings, etc are all fear inducing, they aren't despair inducing like a dead loved one. The difference is that if you are emotionally experiencing despair, there is always the belief a past event has caused irreparable harm to you, and so to some degree, there is always the belief that the event is to some degree still ongoing.  This means whenever anyone experiences despair related to their self-image, they immediately engage in problem solving actions to \"try to fix it\", whereas if you experience fear in relationship to memory or thought then you don't try to fix anything, you just try to avoid, rationalize, or get away from it. While again this is quite interesting, I would mainly emphasize that all of it is unnecessary because you don't need to have emotional relationship to those beliefs in the first place, but my personal guess is that a good way to do a controlled study on what is really important underneath his research is to start breaking things down based on what each emotion means and how it is experienced, but I know that is very hard because of the subjectivity to it.","timestamp":"2023-12-03T01:49:15.270000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-03T01:52:18.983000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"210575654524026880","username":"dimefox.","avatar":"11af762583dd387f7fcdc219e76efbf2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"dime","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180437340229996595","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180685046269608066","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Didn't read the article (classic) as reading these things usually really frustrate me, but just going off the headline and opening line, the reason traumatic memories are processed as present experiences is because you literally are experiencing a present experience. What is occurring is simply \"emotional relationship to my present thoughts\" which is exactly the self-image we all talk about here. You can't \"experience the past\" what is happening is you are imagining something in the present and emotionally reacting to that image because you believe that you are imagining \"Me\". It's the same as a nightmare. It doesn't matter if you are having a dream about the past, the present, the future, or about another reality, the only thing that is actually happening is \"the present experience of a nightmare\". In a nightmare you are experiencing hallucinations from memory and believe your are in it and being affected by those things as if they were real. You can't have a \"nightmare about the past\" you can only \"have a nightmare\" because nightmares always occur \"now\". All thoughts, beliefs, and trauma works the same way. You cannot react to the past or future, you can only react to present thought.\n\nFor context, the emotional relationship to all traumatic memories can completely end because trauma is one of the most salient components of our self-image/ego/self-knowledge. Trauma is itself the belief \"something very seriously bad has occurred to me\". This is the reason two people can have the same event occur to them, one person grows up and doesn't care, while the other might be severely emotionally hurt. It is the reason someone who grew up very sheltered is emotionally traumatized by their dad getting mad at them for poor grades, while someone from a war-torn nation can be like \"It was a good year, only 2 people I know died\". Emotional trauma is itself the belief that something in particular very seriously bad has occurred to you, and that belief is itself the trauma, not the actual event as all that remains of the event is memory and belief.

That I think is the next election and it is unfortunately not a matter of an exchange of ideas, but a question of \"well, why wouldn't you vote for me?\"","timestamp":"2023-12-01T09:27:59.355000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-01T09:45:51.369000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"210575654524026880","username":"dimefox.","avatar":"11af762583dd387f7fcdc219e76efbf2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"dime","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180051479332134942","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180051121222451221","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Oh sorry, wrong chat.

Simultaneously, your actual physical suffering is way worse, because you have to work a very demanding physical labour job or you don't eat. If you watch documentaries on people who live in the Amazon rainforest or in Mongolia as semi-tribal people, they really experience very little neuroticism because they don't have greater beliefs about their life, but they do also have severe limitations like dying of illness, not marrying who they want, and basically experiencing life in a very limited capacity. \n\nIn my personal view the things we've always been unsure about emotionally have been solved by Religion until about 150-250 years ago when the scientific process really started rolling. If you lived in 1500, I mean who the fuck had any idea why the universe existed, why there are bright stars in the sky at night, why you exist, why you die, etc. What the fuck? Nowadays we have explanations for nearly everything and so we have this emotional void of \"I don't understand why I exist, where I go, what I am, and what to do\" and the previous doctrine that explained it (Religion) is seen as obsolete literature. From that we now idolize people, politics, and money, becuase what else is there that is \"above our experience\"?. Self-realization as we talk about here is the next step for people in that camp, but the irony is that it is perceived as \"convincing people of a new thing\" when in reality it is trying to prove to people you already believe something that is false.","timestamp":"2023-12-01T06:50:14.306000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-01T06:53:56.613000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180034563125293087","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180036155949993984","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah, that's great and it sounds like a wholesome experience.

You can say \"our country is the best country ever!\" and you can look around and say \"yeah, we are pretty awesome!\" and that becomes a belief.\n\nIt might sound dramatic, but all our major religions, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc. are all based on people who tried to communicate self-realization, just in their own exaggerated way 2000 years ago roughly. The religious component then evolved as a form of moral rules and social belief in order to usher in modern civilization as we learned to create global trade and living with other people in large communities. \n\nIn a very truncated way, if you really, really, trusted me, I could say \"anxiety is the fear of your nightmares coming true, never trust it because it will always try to lure you there\", and any person might be like \"oh ok cool that sounds about right\", but it is just an idea I've made up that romanticizes a real underlying emotional phenomenon. That's how major religion came about, which was actual, genuine insight being turned into moral guidance based on knowledge and rules we all intuitively think are roughly in line with our own experience.

I really like stoicism, as I think it was the philosophy that came the absolute closest to self-realization and a philosophy around \"how to live\" which is \"act according to [your] nature\". The only thing they missed was that their view was one of aligning personal self-knowledge and beliefs with our own nature as if they are two things. Conventionally, we experience them as two things, which are our actual self and our self-image, but their attitude was \"make them the same\", which takes a lifetime of experience, thought, knowledge, and intelligence. I would again state that if you are living with your own self-image and suffer from it emotionally, as most people do, then stoicism is the highest form of \"how should I live?\" philosophy, but it is not the whole story and you can go beyond the need to rationalize self-experience and emotionally relate to your thoughts about yourself and the chronic emotional torment that creates.","timestamp":"2023-12-01T06:01:47.545000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-01T06:02:08.146000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1180019593864032318","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180021715762417704","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@tsnnoy Before we all go fully discord moment, I'd respond to what you're saying in that you're being compassionate and understanding, but the main underlying point to someone like the unabomber or any extreme political figure like Hitler, Bin Laden, even going back to admired leaders like Alexander the Great or Ghengis Khan, was that the reason they acted the way they did was because they believed they were doing something good in response to their present beliefs about the world and their own experiences. That is the only point worth examining which is even someone as fucked up as a serial killer or terrorist doesn't do it because \"I want to hurt everyone\" they do it because they think they are doing something good. Many believe for example that society is morally wrong and must be destroyed, and like the Joker they think they are doing something beneficial. Leaders in the past believe their people and themselves are morally righteous and will bring greater leadership to other countries and so they are justified. All religions have done this, all nations have done this, and it is currently happening around the globe right now. Look at Ukraine/Russia, look at Israel/Palestine. How many people say \"fuck, it's a complicated scenario when you look at the various rationales, how are we going to solve this?\" vs. \"yeah these people are fucked up, wrong, and they should be wiped off the map\". The more important observation is that we obviously know that terrorist acts are fucked up and immoral, but then you look at Hitler and realize he was legally elected. The entire point is that everyone does fucked up things because they have strong enough beliefs to justify them. What are the beliefs? Why do they arise? What is their origin and do they need to exist? That is the main point and what I want to bring the conversation back to.","timestamp":"2023-12-01T05:45:00.781000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-01T05:49:07.485000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"417947939999186945","username":"tsnnoy","avatar":"c76ad0f8e8d23b85b92c326a83c9393a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"will","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1179968267671064596","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1180018958762516500","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@mr.niceguy312 To respond to both of you, there is nothing wrong with frustration and that never goes away.

I don't think about \"my childhood\" or \"my old memories\" at all, but would be very happy to try to reconnect with some old friends if I went back to Australia for example, I just have no expectation they will be anything like before and don't care if they ruin that literal image (how I remember them) either. The positive emotional relationship to past memories only occurs because it temporarily interrupts present discontent. What happens is you feel something along the lines of \"oh man, I don't really have a group of friends to hang out with\" and then you *remember* the past gaming, elementary school, or online days when things were just right, and that temporarily relieves the discontent and creates an exaggerated emotional response. \n\nBoth positive and negative emotions don't go away, they are just very rarely experienced as 98% of the time they are experienced in our usual life unnecessarily in relationship to imagination. When physical occurrences are happening, you experience every emotion when necessary, but they are always related to immediate perception, rather than belief, imagination, or dream.\n\nIt might sound a bit strange, but the only positive emotion is love. If you feel really fucking shitty, and then things finally go right, we call that ectasy \"happiness\" or \"elation\" but it is just one emotion, which is love. The negation of chronic negative emotion is often experienced as love, but it is just that, which is the compensatory effect of not striving or struggling anymore. If you don't experience any neurotic emotion, then you are permanently \"at peace\" which is what I used to refer to and what most people refer to as \"happy and content\" when their personal goals are met. That is still not love, love being something that is genuinely experienced from deep communication with a romantic partner or from feeling you are \"two brain cells in a pod\" with someone else, and much more rare. I speculate it might occur with your own child but I haven't had one so I have no clue on that, but it seems likely.\n\nLong story short, positive emotions don't go away because love is the only thing you ever pursue. There are about 4 or 5 negative emotions that tell you to not hurt others, die, or to protect innocent life forms, but the only positive emotion is to act out your nature and to reward you for acting out what you really are meant to do and what you want to do.","timestamp":"2023-11-29T23:24:40.453000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-29T23:44:58.930000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1179488458004238406","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1179561983389990993","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah, drawing girl's rooms dude\n\nfr I did google women's makeup mirror to expand the image you are definitely onto something","timestamp":"2023-11-29T23:18:12.042000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-29T23:26:01.421000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"703324340099481720","username":"buzzz_89","avatar":"97b28f97ccece9e551e012752213e1df","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"buzzz","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1179463710352363522","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1178439815423873134","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@everyone running a smidge late will be in VC in 15 mins get ur hot chocolate","timestamp":"2023-11-26T20:59:06.350000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":true,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1177800454592286770","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@everyone Sorry for the recent pings, I'll do it less in the future unless there is an event like this.

I didn't have it so bad that it was literally uncontrollable, and you could sort of relieve it by doing a milder form of whatever the impulse was. Like if the tic was to roll your eyes or pull your hair, you could sort of strain your eyes a certain way or pull your shirt instead and that would partially satisfy it. If you were threatened with literal death if you did something, for me it would have been like having your hand on a hot, but not unbearably hot stove, so I would probably endure it if it was temporary.

With regards to addiction I'd certainly say there's a difference between a psychological addiction and physical one. I used to have a moderate degree of Tourette's from 5-14 that I luckily grew out of nearly entirely, but remembering having \"tics\" it was literally a borderline uncontrollable impulse for certain behaviour. Like the same sort of feeling when you are running out of air underwater and feel an uncontrollable impulse to resurface and breathe, but it would just happen every 15-30 seconds. I'm sure there are many physical addictions that are basically the result of a chemical addiction that results in similar sort of physical impulses, but yeah, mostly psychological addictions like caffeine or alcohol, or purely psychological addictions like gambling I think are almost always coping mechanisms for internal emotional problems or lack of external stimulus. Like you are saying they either dull an emotional pain or induce a temporary elation or stimulus that is preferable to the present state. \n\nWith regards to willpower, self-image and emotional relationship can create an illusion of immense \"willpower\" like in someone like David Goggins or the like, but it all stems from emotional suffering. If for example someone had a gun to your kids head and said \"keep running or else\", most parents would literally run until they themselves died of exhaustion because of the immediate emotional threat. But if you said \"keep running until you don't feel like running\" most people would probably run 4 or 5 blocks. Physical tiredness plays an obvious role in how that plays out, and is the underlying natural thing we treat as willpower, but also whatever your beliefs about yourself are create emotional relationship to what you think is occurring that cause actual physical motivation. An example is if you think no person will ever date you if you aren't super skinny and that by being able to run a marathon you will prove your spiteful parents wrong, then you will be extremely motivated by anger and anxiety to run farther than you would naturally actually want to because you think you're doing something you aren't actually doing. In nearly all motivational content and even in motivational psychology this is the underlying factor that differentiates \"motivated people\" from \"lazy people\". It's just their beliefs about what they are doing is different. \n\nRelated to energy levels, one of the more interesting things post-realization is that the concept of \"introvert/extrovert\" is seen as completely made up. There is no such thing as expending or gaining energy from social interaction or reclusion. You are most energetic when you wake up and most tired when you go to sleep that's the only variable, exactly like a plant or most mammals. Any perceived energetic relationship to socialization is just like and dislike for certain people and emotional avoidance or attraction.","timestamp":"2023-11-24T23:23:00.511000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-24T23:29:39.204000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1177678259043967056","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1177746841807364206","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah it's pretty normal to imagine how you appeared to other people when you did something, but it's also usually a sign you're worrying about your literal self-image in the way people use it conversation, not just here. Like if you do something and think \"damn I probably looked so cool/cringe\" it usually is a sign you're emotionally reacting to something that didn't actually happen because when you do something cool or cringe other people communicate it to you and you react to them, you don't react to your own imagination. But yeah it's super normal and I remember doing it a ton. You still do it if you need to reflect on why something went well or didn't go well and it's helpful for empathetic reasoning. Most people in here are younger than me so I will also say that you just get way better at with more experience and as you get older so it's sort of a tool that improves over time. When you are 16 you constantly worry about other people's perspective on you and you're pretty much always wrong lol. \n\nAs an example just to relate it to other people, think of all the photos people upload to their Instagram that are just to manufacture an image. Even more so look at Tinder or dating apps. If you've ever seen a girl swiping through guys, every guy uploads a picture of himself doing something quirky to show he's got a sense of humour, a picture of him fishing, a picture of him with his car/truck, and a picture of him with friends on a vacation. The entire thing is manufacturing an image in the guys mind where he thinks \"ok, the first picture will make me stand out, then the next will show how competent and successful I am, then the next will be me and my friends at our best on holiday so that will entice her to my lifestyle, then of course I caught this giant fish gotta show off how sick that is\", when in reality any girl looking at his profile is like \"lol cringe\". None of those things are what a girl wants to see, but every guy believes he is making his profile to appeal to women, but he's making a profile to appeal to his own imagination of what a woman wants, which is still ultimately his own imagination. \n\nAgain, just because you think about yourself doing something and imagining what it looks like isn't always bad, it's important to think from another person's perspective no matter what you're doing, but the point is that you are not imagining what other people think, you are imagining yourself and reacting to that imagination of yourself. The only person in the equation is your own personal experience and thought. It's the same reason it's not actually possible to \"worry about what other people think of you\" it's only possible to react to their immediate communication or worry about what you would think of yourself if you were another person.","timestamp":"2023-11-24T23:05:28.565000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-24T23:07:38.006000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1177668995017613402","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1177743417846005790","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah agree with both your comments.

Ask neuroscience to point to \"the willpower\" and they will say either \"yeah well we need more data on that\" or \"yeah that's social science not us\".

You can't act outside your own nature, and no matter how much you fight it, you will just be the same thing. Everything in your life is consistent and \"on track\". \n\nWhen most people refer to \"will-power\" they are referring to the emotional desire to fight what they believe themselves to be and conform to what their image of themselves should become. The error is not realizing that this entity is itself their beliefs about themselves in the first place creating the image, which are literally created again by themselves. In brief, no matter what you think you are doing, or whether you aren't thinking while you are doing, you are acting out what you are.  \n\nProbably going a bit too off the rails for the general chat.

I think you're being really reasonable and wouldn't disagree. I don't have American political affiliation in relationship to my own life as I'm Canadian, but I'd reiterate that I think the sole value any human being can contribute is the product of their own intelligence and effort, and that is the constant experience of their life and the pursuit of self-expression/love. While none of this is related to self-realization, I do enjoy the conversation and am involved with it. \n\nThe most anyone can contribute to society is being themselves completely. \n\nI'd say in response to your medical example is that absolutely America has a medical debt problem. America spends more per capita with regards to government gdp than any country in the world on healthcare and does not have universal healthcare. It is not fair or just for the average person, it is fundamentally, legitimately, corrupt and similar to how I despise Canadian telecom or travel. The market signal is not active and people are subject to perverse rates that make no fucking sense because competition is disrupted by political or legal \"go ahead\".  \n\nVery simply it doesn't make sense and there is clearly massive inefficiency. 100% I entirely agree it is a broken system based on all empirical standards for how the budget should be rationally spent. I'd refer to someone like Stanley Druckenmiller and his presentation on entitlement spending as an example of that. He is a conservative, but his views are entirely monetary and worth considering \"we assume America the government has infinite money, does it? How will it play out in the next 20 years?\" And he is painfully right, but no one cares in the same way most people don't care about those things, because they are currently abundant, but will eventually be the lifeblood of our system.\n\nI have sentiments and feelings toward both progressives and conservatives, but the underlying thing they are feeling which is \"how does money affect me? How does culture affect me? How does climate and the environment affect me?\" is often a bit goofy because of its underlying reality that is is established, which is really the conern of \"what is my relationship with the role of money and wealth\". The solution to the problem isn't a question of \"who has too little and who has too much? It's a question of 'what is it?'\"","timestamp":"2023-11-24T07:05:07.386000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-24T07:15:11.079000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"224016719474065408","username":"nasty9225","avatar":"cfc1a296ccc524ab83d29e354452bff9","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"XxReLiCxX","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_2ca5fb1ecf0dac410b38d76cb4aae7f9","sku_id":"1174459546748600481","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1177497759423664128","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1177494082340261929","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah sure in some ways technologically, but it's always individual people doing the achievements.

The vast majority of Osho's commentary is of this nature, which is frustration (lack of communication) which is not anger, but results in forceful communication, but again not defending him he is wildin' out on many accounts so I won't be there to back him up there.

I don't really see it in the same way and would suggest for example that self-realization is not about \"being calm all the time\" it is that you communicate exactly what is the most effective perceived form of communication for the circumstance according to your own experience. Not trying to simp for Osho, I really don't care at all about anyone's judgment about him, but saying \"oh man he seemed annoyed\" is fundamentally meaningless if there is no underlying emotional state and it is just communicative. If there is an underlying emotional state and he legitimately angry, then I would change my whole view, but I don't really see evidence of that as he is one of the only people who I currently really think expresses what self-realization is, albeit a bit esoterically or theatrically. With me. J.K. or Eckhart or anyone who is human, if your measurement of \"are they legit or not\" is \"do I think they are expressing frustration???\" then that is entirely incumbent on the individual making the judgment, not the character acting out perceived crime. The main point being that I can communicate in any way, happy, sad, angry, scared, etc. That is just communication and how intelligent thought works case by case to pretend to do something, but to actually communicate emotionally what you really think and believe is entirely related to a different structure of just \"what I really feel compelled to share that would benefit others\".","timestamp":"2023-11-17T06:44:57.188000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-17T06:49:42.773000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1135121138545066095","username":"itsneekeetah","avatar":"f42f13524c5220149866d9b953093a7e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"itsneekeetah","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1174957976914759711","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1174958250932830298","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah basically my view is he's the comedian's comedian of self-realization.

So other than what Rupert talks about in regards to what the \"Self\" is which seems roughly in line with what I would sort of say and we very well may be talking about the same thing. Simultaneously, the effort to rationalize or assert a \"God\" is a bit clumsy in my view. I don't really like when he says \"the highest prayer is silent... because we cannot go from silence to our self\" [??????]. \n\n\"because any movement away from ourself would be a movement away from God\" [??????]\n\nIf what he really means, which I will give him the benefit of the doubt, is \"you cannot move from what is the case to something this not the case. Every single moment of your life what is happening is what is happening\" that I could probably cut him some slack. \n\nI think it is absolutely crazy to assert anything positive (implying something is the case) with regards to belief other than: \"that which is, is\". My personal view is that the only defensible view regarding God is \"Life itself is God\" or \"reality as it is experienced is God\", or as an extension of that, \"all that exists outside of perceptual experience is God\" then sure.

It is similar to the concept of \"Truth\" that religions and mystics always purport, question, and debate over. Straightforwardly, the underlying fact of what is \"Truth\" is simply \"that which is the case\". You don't need to know, because it is always the case, that is what truth is. The cessation of emotional relationship to belief causes you to realize that \"Truth\" is simply always here, always present, always the case.

Self-realization in comparison was completely subtle and not a \"high\" in any way, it was instead the cessation of all negative experience I commonly had in relationship to thought and beliefs about myself. It wasn't \"being super fucking happy\" it was \"perfect mental health\". I think it is the reason people in Eastern beliefs obsess over Kundalini and related things like Yoga and Meditation, and I think it is why western people obsess over mushrooms and psychedelic experiences. They all have an \"experience\" and want to have it again. While this might be an unusual take, the origin of basically all modern religions has been a person who has understood and tried to communicate self-realization with various degrees of conviction combined with certain opinions towards life.

I have spent a little bit of time drawing pictures for the essay I wrote and used the ox herding pictures as the intro picture as well. Very big fan of Zen generally and I think they are the best at communicating self-realization the phenomenon absent of belief, but the problem is that it is so purist and influenced by Japanese hierarchical culture nowadays that it's hard to get to the meaning of it. I look at a lot of passed down Zen traditions and think \"holy shit that is exactly correct\" but the tradition is done by someone who doesn't understand and they just imitate it religiously. An example is the \"post self-realization\" attitude of Zen which the pursuit of harm-reduction. This is extremely correct when done naturally as a description of \"what does a self-realized person do?\", but then people who don't understand take it all which ways and think it means \"don't eat animals\" or \"don't ever hurt someone's feelings\" etc. It can mean that, but it doesn't mean that if you do it because you think it is right. The difference is \"what does a self-realized person do?\" Rather than \"what do I do to be like a self-realized person?\". \n\nJust to reinforce what you're saying \n\"An attachment to the outcome instead of working the process.\" is based on our beliefs about ourselves. \n\n\"Feeling like you’ve done something huge at some level, making one complacent in one’s practice.\" is based on our beliefs about ourselves.\n\n \"Retaining the belief that there is a “me” who is improving\" is of course based on our beliefs about ourselves. \n\nThe only lesson of Zen and self-realization is the \"blank space\" represented in the ox herding pictures, that represents self-realization and the cessation of the story/narrative. This is the reason why after realization there is one panel of self-reflection, which represents the \"new state\" of \"oh shit, this is what I am and always have been\", and then the next panel is going back to the community to share. It is exactly what I hope I can do as effectively as possible, but the realization is that everything before the \"a-ha!\" is a meaningless constructed narrative, but in that structure it was necessary. I look back at the experiences that led me to this and see \"oh shit, that really makes sense\" but in terms of what I was ultimately looking for it was never necessary, I just believed it was, and that is the construction of our beliefs about ourselves.","timestamp":"2023-11-17T01:48:40.004000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"198801220721311744","username":"aquadementia","avatar":"ec133577b84250bc5ba2f83023500c27","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"kibble","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1173772543103078511","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1174885178540310560","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It is phenomenological and permanent, and while I value the sanctity of the chat, I will ignore that temporarily to say it's basically equivalent in scope and physical experience to permanent post-nut clarity but of the imagination of yourself.","timestamp":"2023-11-17T01:34:14.875000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-17T01:34:36.953000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"703251615674662916","username":"mr.niceguy312","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"mr.niceguy","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1173750729371041822","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1174884732966809610","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just because you are using an interesting math analogy, to expand on that from my perspective in a different direction, the way self-image operates with regards to beliefs is that you will be satisfied with a \"sufficient\" argument or idea that serves a greater purpose emotionally.

The only thing that \"dies\" is a belief in something that doesn't exist, which is literally relegated only to the realm of thought. The best example I hark back on is imagining a kid who believes in Santa Claus, emotionally reacts to Santa Claus, and dictates their behaviour and moral actions on Santa Claus. They then learn Santa Claus isn't real. This is the same phenomenon. It just sounds really scary because  'Santa Claus' is \"Me\".

Afterwards though then do whatever you want lol knock yourself out, but to see and understand clearly what you are as a human being is only really likely if you are sober to clearly investigate it with thought and sensory experience. \n\nI've said this previously but my current view is that psychedelic's primary effect on thought is the amplification of present memory/experience which is experienced as \"dreaming while you are awake\" and novel, amplified connections being created in our experience. Meaning you will experience what you currently believe but more seriously and convincingly. This is helpful for people with self-doubt issues, which are common with anxious or depressed people, because it makes them think things like \"I should do what I truly want, fuck people who judge me I should live in a way that brings me happiness\", etc. I remember when I first tried them I saw all of my friends as archetypes and mythological characters that appeared to me at the time as \"holy shit, so true, I didn't recognize it before but this is completely correct\". It was something I wasn't consciously aware of but if I thought about it really hard I would have come to the same conclusion. Point is that the belief already existed and the psychedelics amplified it and caused it to be basically be hallucinated/dreamed and perceived. I now look back and would say that entire experience was incorrect and based on my beliefs at the time. I didn't experience \"what was true\" I experienced an amplification of my beliefs at the highest level.","timestamp":"2023-11-11T07:33:35.625000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-11T07:36:47.798000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"703251615674662916","username":"mr.niceguy312","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"mr.niceguy","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1172603322985877597","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1172799322870517800","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I don't mean this as a redirect, but I think a helpful idea would be to go and listen to the essay I wrote on my channel again if you've listened to it and notice that what you perceive from it is different from what you initially remembered.

This might be difficult to grapple with generally, but it isn't a logic problem to understand and prove to yourself in thought, it is really understanding something that is currently completely misunderstood as its glanced over entirely. While I think it's great to develop knowledge and understanding of ego, the majority of people in the chat believe that ego is like a pimple in their brain that they are trying to combat, when in reality the thing they are using to attack it is also ego.

What that experience was is probably more along the lines of beliefs around Kundalini like you've described or what Maslow actually pursued in his later life after his hierarchy of needs as a result of his own similar experience. While I think tons of people historically have experienced that and created beliefs systems around that I truly do not think it is very important. Similarly, if you take a lot of psychedelics, you will immediately realize that a huge amount of historical religious myths are based on hallucinogens, as they occur to you and experienced clear as day.

In a straightforward way he is referring to how we are all cut from the same cloth and experience thought, emotions, and experience in nearly identical ways. We are all humans and so our experience of the machinery is the same as any other. There are of course exceptions with genetic defects and severe illnesses, but by and large we are all the same type of machine. We aren't ants, we aren't whales, we are humans. As a quick example, close your eyes, pretend you've forgotten all of your life experience, and then open your eyes as if you were suddenly alive for the first time.

I'd say that this isn't really a super important thing related to self-realization so it doesn't matter that much.

He lived through WW1, WW2, the cold war and Vietnam along with other Indian and international conflicts, and so a huge part of his messaging was \"what the fuck are you guys doing?\" that we don't really relate to as much to today. Not to be inflammatory because I know people are sensitive about this, but take Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Palestine right now. The vast, vast majority of people see it as \"this side good, this side bad\" which is deep infatuation with personal beliefs that create bad people and good people, when in reality we are all human and all fundamentally the same. The citizens of each country and each area are all the same human. There can of course be horrible actions and leadership worth condemning or fighting, but the belief that one group of humans possess evil traits and another positive ones because of a categorization and relationship in thought is a self-created delusion that drives hatred and conflict in the world.

For example when we say \"memory can't fully represent the original\" that is the belief memory/thought is representing something, when it isn't. An example would be saying something like \"that food tasted so good dude it was like the best thing I've ever tasted\" and your friend saying \"oh shit dude, how good was it?\", \"Oh I couldn't express it you had to actually try it\". Then imagine that your friend could access your memories, he would then say \"holy shit, wow that is one of the best tasting things I've ever had too!\" and then you would say \"uh no, you weren't there? You didn't actually taste it.\"\n\nIn reality, once you are no longer tasting something, all that exists is your memory of it, and if that person were to have your memory, they would be having the same exact experience. The belief that you are recalling a past experiencing is false, all that you are doing is accessing what is currently available in memory using thought. We believe that we are remembering  taste from a month ago, but we are actually experiencing thought presently and nothing else. This means if someone had your memory they have exactly the same experience you currently do despite never having tasted that food. Seeing and understanding this process is really the crux of self-realization and what is the \"Me\" in general. \n\nBesides that yeah thinking and memory is like the compressed and lossy highlights of things you've experienced before. An interesting thing to note in subjective experience is that all of your dreams are always a flow state because they are constructed from memory and contain no \"downtime\" because that isn't stored in memory.","timestamp":"2023-11-10T04:43:33.311000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-10T06:02:49.664000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1172129889575501845","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1172099882274787408","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"This is true I'd also suggest that you don't have knowledge of the future or the past.

When we are going to a a party or about to go on a date, what happens? Most of us get anxious and worry about something going wrong. The belief that something that could occur that is wrong is what creates anxiety. The reason this occurs is because we imagine a possible future outcome that would be undesirable, and that creates anxiety in relationship to that belief. This means that when we go on our date or to a party if that event occurs, then that negative social feedback will validate this belief and cause our anxiety to turn into sadness or despair, which is the change in our beliefs about ourselves to something less desirable. The error that is occurring is that it is not at all possible to imagine a future possible outcome that you will experience. The mistake with regards to \"the render\" is that we believe that right now we can perceive the future or past, which we can't. When someone says \"I'm anxious about my date tomorrow\" that is a misinterpretation of thought. You are anxious only about your present thoughts about your beliefs. It is thought relating to thought it isn't any real circumstance. The false belief that you are legitimately imagining a future scenario you will experience is what causes the anxiety and the belief you are experiencing something \"outside of the present\".\n\nA small example would be if you had plans for the weekend, and then looked at the weather report that said \"yeah this weekend it's going to rain\" and you think \"wow fuck weather dude, you're going to rain on my fucking weekend?????\" In reality you aren't actually mad at the weekend's weather, you are mad at todays weather model.

The \"true nature\" that you discover is not like a psychedelic high-point, it is the absence of anxiety, anger, regret, envy, comparison, and emotional suffering. You don't arrive at a  heightened state, you arrive at what is more like an invulnerable state in response to self-imagination, and then true love and compassion can then be experienced and achieved through positive physical action that makes the world a better place for you and others. If you are engaging with conventional meditation or incremental self-enquiry, you can absolutely make incremental progress, but that incremental progress has to be realized to not actually lead to anything. You can become less anxious, and that is great, you can become less remorseful, and that is great. In the same way meditation in the way it is usually taught is incremental. It seems it is helpful in improving people's moods and neurotic emotions. That's great and I'd support it. It doesn't actually ever lead to a climax, it is a spiritual form of self-improvement that has no clearly delineated resolution. I'd still very straightforwardly say \"that's cool, might have a lot of value, but it isn't what I'm talking about at all\". \n\n\"true nature\" is really understanding what you are absent of beliefs about what you think you are.

IIRC he is a pastor or academic theologian of some sorts but is immensely curious and open-minded. Really curious and intelligent guy. At any rate, I completely agree with J.K.'s sentiment, and just to expand for everyone who might read/listen and would get value from the same thing being rephrased in a way that may or may not be more digestible:\n\n*\"Am I awake? Or am I only awake when there is a shock? When there is crisis?\" * \n\nThis refers to how we respond absolutely, naturally, intelligently to any immediate threat or reaction. When we truly experience a threat to our child, sibling, or friend, we respond immediately and intelligently, when we experience fear at a dangerous ledge when we're skiing, we respond immediately and intelligently. In contrast, nearly all of our day to day experience of \"action and reaction\" is we have one thought, then we don't like that thought, so we react to that thought, and then we think another thought, and then maybe we execute that thought, and then halfway through we have another thought and do something different. This is what is referred to as \"not being awake\" in that we are constantly emotionally victims to and respond to our own ebb and flow of imagination like a leaf in the wind or like a nightmare or dream. This doesn't mean \"set a goal and do it\" or \"ignore the anxiety\", it means, simply \"observe that you are constantly in flux with your thoughts and emotions, rarely with destination or consistency\". This is an important part of self-enquiry, where all that is being asked is to observe and say \"yes, that is true\", and not to reject and say \"oh fuck is that *bad* oh god well I better be more certain in the future\". The whole starting point he is trying to introduce is to observe \"yes, I do that. I see it, and it is true\". That is now a new piece of information you literally stop on and and can use to inquire further.\n\n*\"When the past covers the present, then I'm asleep\" *\n\nThis is similar to the above and means when we encounter a new experience, we automatically intellectually and emotionally relate to it through the lens of the past, which is what I've referred to as beliefs. If you match with someone on Tinder and arrange a date, when you say \"oh god she is so out of my league I better watch some rizz videos on TikTok to win her over\", anyone with two brain cells would be like \"oh noooooooooo\". Because what has happened is the individual belief that you are not worthy of your date based on passed experience creates the psychological demand to compensate for the perceived deficiency, and now you are acting in accordance to an imaginary persona that would be more likable. While this is very specific, it is an example of the past smothering the present in imagination. The person doing this will have no idea what they did wrong because they are fundamentally asleep by the original concept. They cannot conceptualize the actual miscommunication because they are lost in their own beliefs and imagination.\n\n\"Now I am choiceless awareness\" \n\nThis was kind of rapidly glossed over but there's the whole realization lol. Really it's just J.K. being like \"ok well anyway now to tell you what I think and experience\". \n\n\"meditation covers the whole field of life\"\n\nThis is really the most important thing on meditation as it is completely true. Meditation is both the quality of all experience of life and also the effortful and conscious examination of it. Speaking practically it is the permanent understanding and experience of the envelope of experience. If I were to loosely describe genuine meditation, it would be the examination of consciousness, only when there is realization that consciousness is all that you can ever examine. You can't get better at genuine meditation, you can only realize you are always experiencing it.","timestamp":"2023-11-08T07:29:48.663000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-08T07:35:53.533000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1171702092134617109","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1171679370360913980","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yes, to add, all forms of thought are conjugations of memory, they are the sensory perception of \"intelligence reconfiguring memory\".

It isn't exactly a reversion to a tabula rasa, but it is seeing that you always were one. The sad radio program is our self-image, which is as we've talked about is the imagination of ourselves. The reason I didn't make videos for a year and worked on this so much is because it is genuinely \"permanent and perfect mental health\" that arises from realizing that no past or future exists other than in thought, and all emotional trauma is the belief that there are objects in thought that create beliefs about ourselves and what life and reality is. The physiological cessation of this false belief resolves all related suffering and neuroticism. In the past, self-realization has sometimes been referred to as \"waking up from the dream\", which refers to ceasing to identify with the imagined reality an extremely neurotic person lives within from their own unfortunate experience with past trauma and how it has affected their beliefs about others, themselves and the world. I am saying this as someone who had chronic anxiety for 15 years and would genuinely say that if I didn't discover this phenomenon I would have barely lived a week of happiness in my whole life ahead of me. When it first occurred to me I literally told everyone I could because it is fundamentally the cure to emotional mental illness. Unfortunately it is like telling people their religion causes their own suffering which isn't received very well.

It is impossible because you can only think of one thought at a time. What J.K. refers to is if there is cessation of emotional relationship to thought and belief, then memory isn't something you consciously are aware of. If someone asks you a question, you answer, and you suddenly reveal what you know based on past memory/experience. Truly being \"intelligent\" as he describes it, is to constantly have original thought (based on your own memory) everytime you are asked something and having no idea what you are going to say, that way it is always new. This doesn't mean you can't repeat yourself or prepare a speech, it means to be constantly creative in all actions you are consciously performing or attending to. As an example, I literally have no clue what I'm going to say to anyone who types in chat, I just see it and start typing, and miraculously some form of cohesive human thought emerges. You and everyone else works exactly the same, there is just another thought that comes in sometimes and says \"oh, I am an expert on this, of course I know!\", instead of just immediate reaction to someone communicating.

Yes! \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with thought the sensory perception, the problem is that because it so pronounced but unexamined, we give it properties it doesn't have. Self-enquiry is really trying to break out of the constant identification with objects of thought to see that thought itself is the object with nothing inside of it at all, like a computer monitor or hologram, and that automatically causes your biology to reclaim or reaffirm its identity as \"oh shit, what the fuck was I doing worrying about my thoughts\".","timestamp":"2023-11-03T07:43:07.668000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"776884386372255755","username":"q__c_","avatar":"9da34bdb46f23c4e74ef91e6b87fde84","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Q-C","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1167839023524487340","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1169902806925332581","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It is honestly like realizing that trying to figure out who you are with knowledge and thought is dividing by 0.

Our self-image essentially causes us to experience everything twice, once for certain in imagination and perhaps another time in reality. It is never necessary to react to something imaginary because it can *never* exist in reality as thinking is just part of reality as it currently exists so it can't be the past or future. I talk about it in my essay near the end using the tv screen analogy.

I'd ask a question like \"why do you perceive xyz as a barrier?\", but that is mostly rhetorical.\n\nI'll give you an example from where I'd come from right away. If someone said to me \"what do you think the meaning of life is?\", my immediate reflex is \"this person is unhappy and looking to find knowledge they haven't heard that will either ease or confirm their ambitions for the future\". This only occurs to me because the only necessity for intellectual meaning is the desire for an ideal to allow certainty in action. This person is uncertain, unhappy, ambitious, and they deeply want to act, but don't know what to do specifically and worry they are going to waste their time on the wrong thing.\n\nIf instead you took the question and ran with it, you would get 5000 years of philosophy, ideologies, idealism, religion, and the invention of perfect afterlifes based on intention rather than action, etc. etc. There is no resolution to \"what should I do?\" The only resolution is going backwards and resolving why you ask the question. That's the purpose of self-enquiry, which is to get more practical again is to take a question like:\n\n\"I went on a date today. I felt it went okay, but not great. I texted them if they wanted to hang out again at 9pm. It is now 11pm and they haven't responded and now I feel really anxious\". It is important to ask \"why?\" as the start of the inquiry, but eventually what you will find is that what you're fleshing out is \"I am scared of this person rejecting me. I don't want to think I'm a loser on a date, and I don't like the idea of being single for longer than I thought I would be. That would be bad\". If you then look *literally* at what is happening, you can see \"I'm scared of my imagination of what might happen to me\".

I wish I could say it is having no emotional relationship to thought, which is more digestible, which it also is 98% of the time but there are exceptions. The other difficulty is that people are attached to their emotional relationship to their imagination of themselves only because once they live up to its expectations, they will be \"happy\". With no self-image you immediately realize your default state is happiness, and that is what you get once your self-image stops demanding you do imaginary things you think you need to emotionally. It is in my view the origin of \"happiness is within\" and the same insight religious figures tried to share that started most major religions and many people have experienced since but were less influential. It isn't being in a psychedelic trance like people think it is nowadays, it is essentially perfect mental health. It is a physiological phenomenon and the reason why I am personally hoping I can get brain scans done and stuff like that to legitimize it as I talk about it more. A huge problem is that this whole concept is 99% people saying \"well, meditation is a journey, and as someone who's done it for 10 years, the self is a constant new understanding\", and while that sounds great, that's ego and self-knowledge, and not what it is. It is an instantaneous and a permanent but mild change in perception that results in no emotional neuroticism at all, and then over time there is gained knowledge and clarity on new experiences that differs from before, but that is just more accurate use of knowledge and thought that before. I'll just emphasize once more, that as an example, there is the experience of fear in relationship to a bear or tall cliff, but there is absolutely no anxiety at all, it cannot be experienced as you realize \"oh, the thing I was scared of *cannot* exist\".","timestamp":"2023-10-22T07:50:25.235000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"710001930654449664","username":"smorto","avatar":"a_2578ee9c37b5e2545c410645128d322c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"soi","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b4dcf63b6af2e20cba91af61c0e3a8a7","sku_id":"1333866045261480007","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1349849614286585866","asset":"nameplates/nameplates/cityscape/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_CITYSCAPE_A11Y","palette":"violet"}},"display_name_styles":{"font_id":8,"effect_id":3,"colors":[16725190]},"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1165023715042545745","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1165553256693501972","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"pov you get a compliment from cute barista","timestamp":"2023-10-22T07:32:31.328000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1164930254557687809","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1165549926827184148","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"If you are trying to figure out a way to be less anxious rather than to inquire into \"Me\", you aren't wasting your time, but your experience will probably be more akin to therapy, self-improvement, philosophy, or spirituality. It's a bit like meditation in my view, in that basically everyone says \"yeah meditation really helped me\". Just from my own experience, if you want to \"improve\" (aka lessen) your own circumstance dependent anxiety, it is almost always the most effective to improve your skillset in that area and then have repeated positive experiences to reduce expectation of probable negative outcomes. Anxiety, opposed to fear, is the \"butterflies in my stomach\" feeling/nervousness/adrenal response and the perception of imagined danger. In this context, anxiety is always \"fear of a probable imagined negative outcome\". Self-realization causes the complete realization there is no negative outcome because what you are fearing isn't negative, doesn't affect you, and also doesn't exist in the way you interpreted it. So my personal view is that it's a good idea to pursue practical self-improvement and conventional behavioural changes, while also looking at this as the like the parallel thing.","timestamp":"2023-10-22T07:19:17.426000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"814015783881408522","username":".geode","avatar":"62293841c2129d29e9a6dd06f6a6328c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Geode","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1164755410587226144","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1165546427506765905","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Golfama Buddha also led to the creation of the 8-hole noble path, the optimal and superior way of getting to the drink girl on the 9th to buy more cider.","timestamp":"2023-10-22T07:05:23.123000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1164653623624601751","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1165546008764235906","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The past and future don't psychologically exist and are not ever experienced.

Possibly, but pyschologically you do not experience past or future at all. There has never been a moment you have ever looked at a clock and it was any other time than \"now\" the only place that past or future exists is in thought, and thought only exists now. The objects in thought represent or abstract memory into images or symbols we mistakenly believe exist as the objects they represent. The classic example I often bring up is dreams, which causes us to react to the content of dreams as if they were real automatically. Waking thoughts work the same way but we call them \"beliefs\". They are something we think is happening that isn't happening. I use the analogy of thinking of imagination/thought as drawing images on a piece of paper. You cannot draw an image of the past or future, you can only draw an image in the present.

I'd also throw in that I would readily recognize I think a lot of my attitude around self-realization could come off as snobbish or exclusive because the way I relate to it is unconventional or non-spiritual. When I listen to J.K., Osho, Eckart Tolle, Ramana, or some religious figures, I'm pretty on board and trying to represent them in good faith because I'm trying to support the underlying thing that they mean to communicate. When I listen to a lot of new-age spiritualists, usually I don't relate at all to what the say, but it could be because I just don't have the same background. They might have the same understanding and what I'm criticizing is how they communicate. That's not their fault, that's mine. But I also think that communication is important and if you're in the business of trying to share your own experience to others then it is really important to be direct as possible. I don't like disagreeing with people usually, but for example sometimes people mention Sam Harris and say \"oh, you're saying the same thing as him!\" and while he uses the same language because we both have academic western backgrounds (he certainly has the PhD), we are absolutely not saying the same thing.

This is akin to many people and my own experiences taking psychedelics or peak experiences in general, it has nothing to do with self-realization. Maybe the guy would agree with this, but self-realization results in, very specifically, the cessation of emotional relationship to the imagination of ourselves. That's what it is. Again I haven't watched the whole podcast, but when there is a 2 hour podcast, and 1 hour 50 minutes is about stages of awakening and experiences and books and knowledge, to me it is all goofy. Again, this might be specific to what i want to communicate, but if someone really is trying to communicate the actual phenomenon, 95% of their reason is \"how do I communicate this to people to help them?\" it is isn't \"holy shit I had this rad experience and this crazy insight from it\".

I'd throw in that it is very possible that if you have extremely strong beliefs about yourself, if they change suddenly to new beliefs, then your personality, emotions, and behaviour can change too, but they are still changing from one set of beliefs to another.

I think they are very much like Alan Watts in many ways, which is very spiritually open, looking for a supernatural solution to the question of what life itself is and means, and are intellectually open and communicative. I would also relate someone secular like Terrance Mckenna in that same crowd. He is ostensible secular but if you listen to him enough you know he truly believes in that there is a knowable \"greater\" experience. I wouldn't criticize or evaluate if what they are saying is right or wrong, because I don't think either of them are sharing self-realization or communicating no self-image. For myself personally, I listen to a lot of people who talk about Buddhism or meditation and it is frustrating that none of them have interest in \"What did Buddha know?\" They only have interest in \"what are the techniques they have taught us?\" and so we get goofy versions of meditation and spirituality.

This for example is what I refer to when I say \"belief\":\n\n*\"I will think a thought (maybe about some task I don’t want to do)*\n*it will create an uncomfortable sensation*\n*my attention will flip rapidly from the thought to the feeling\"*\n\nThis whole structure is a \"belief\". These aren't separate things, these are one physical function and is what I'm suggesting don't happen anymore. It is part of the reason thinking in general is reduced by like 80%. You just don't need emotions for 95% of function if you are in a modern, safe country and you don't need to think that much either. If this is mostly what ADHD is in relationship to then that won't be experienced in the same way either. I am not familiar with the condition personally but am just responding to the points you brought up.","timestamp":"2023-10-13T09:21:13.186000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-13T09:22:40.605000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1161797245084119131","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1162317659807956992","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Observing there is relationship to beliefs and the imagination of ourself is part of the story, the realization comes from seeing the falsity in the self-image and saying \"ok, so what actually am I?\" and resolving that completely.

The difficulty is that J.K. uses a lot of philosophical language in a way that is seen as very mundane and philosophy 202 stuff, but is actually way deeper than they consider it and seems to be what you're looking at.\n\nIn epistemology (iirc) right away they teach you that the study of knowledge is essentially an abstract representation of the world. This is then extrapolated for thousands of years and millions of PhD's and more knowledge. The real juice is seeing \"oh, knowledge isn't an abstract representation of the world, knowledge is thought, and when thought itself is experienced it is a piece of the world, it isn't separate from it\". That is what J.K. and I am saying. \n\nIf for example I look at a tree, I see the tree, obviously, like anyone, but then when I think \"that's a maple I think\" I also view that thought in the identical way I view the tree. They are two completely separate sensory experiences that occur to me in the moment but are aligned and adjacent. An example is if you see someone hit a drum, you see them hit it, and choicelessly you experience the sound. Recognizing ALL thought as present experience coincident with your natural biology and in response to external/internal circumstance is key. If you get to the root of this, there is self-realization and cessation of relationship to an imagined self because the imagined self is not actually you, you are the entity aware of all experience, and thought is one of those experiences just like sight and sound.","timestamp":"2023-10-13T09:07:52.702000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-13T09:10:45.420000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1160050127822651484","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1162313792366055465","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The \"true me\" includes absolutely all experience that you have.

In those communities/people a really common sentiment are things like \"the self is an illusion\", \"what even is real?\" and \"emotions and thoughts are just pieces of experience like clouds in the sky\". While this is a rejection of experience similar to a hyper-achievement driven acceptance of experience like \"you're sad because you're broke, well just get rich!\" like in hyper-masculine self-improvement, they aren't where the solution is on either side, but are rationalizing and intelligent coping mechanisms for the underlying cognitive dissonance between two perceive real objects (me/world).\n\nIn the psychedelic community, one of the most common themes is thoughts and images like this: https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2022_01/vuiwph1m01g71.jpg.420c0d5fdf37c6ebf6a51cb9720f4e87.jpg\n\nWhich is at the absolute limit of a dual way of thinking and the highest way to marry our self-image to present experience, which is the imagination of \"Me\" and  \"The World\"  and uniting them through supernaturalism or more soberly, God. There is no need for this unless there is unreconcilable difference, and self-realization is the cessation of the \"Me\" that allows the resolution of this constant emotional quandary without supernaturalism or cool drug experiences.","timestamp":"2023-10-13T08:13:25.139000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-13T08:15:12.828000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"image","url":"https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2022_01/vuiwph1m01g71.jpg.420c0d5fdf37c6ebf6a51cb9720f4e87.jpg","reference_id":"1162302057932406794","thumbnail":{"url":"https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2022_01/vuiwph1m01g71.jpg.420c0d5fdf37c6ebf6a51cb9720f4e87.jpg","proxy_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/XyOByWraJNdgoYPipY0469aDgj1enSnXsCl9e0nASvk/https/www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2022_01/vuiwph1m01g71.jpg.420c0d5fdf37c6ebf6a51cb9720f4e87.jpg","width":665,"height":666,"content_type":"image/jpeg","flags":0},"content_scan_version":3}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1159266388578402306","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1158713816473931886","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Don't mean to butt in, I'm just catching up on what I've missed in the chat.

I think the important thing to conceptualize is that this isn't a parallel to self-improvement. It is a completely different thing. To draw a goofy metaphor, if you bought flowers for your bf/gf on Valentines day, and then they said \"wow, ok, you bought me flowers but like, you obviously have been completely ignoring the real problems in our relationship if you think this makes up for it!\" it might be easy to say \"um, okay? Wow, I'm just trying to give you something nice, what the fuck? You can't appreciate  the effort I put into buying these flowers!?\". In reality, you might have done something objectively \"better\" for the relationship, but contextually if your partner is unhappy is that action relevant at all? \n\nIf your relationship is bad, buying flowers for someone is meaningless. It's missing the bigger picture. In the same way I think it is a great thing to improve your own life materially, but also ask \"why are you doing that? What are you wanting to improve and why?\" What actually are you trying to do? And that is more important. Self-improvement is really just \"doing the next thing I want to do\", but if it is perceived as \"I'm making myself better than before\" it is always perceived as insufficiency and insecurity. Self-realization is directing our focus and attention to the origin of these things and resolving them.","timestamp":"2023-10-03T10:29:00.523000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-03T11:41:43.080000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"589819099090255894","username":"cyu3281","avatar":"adeb6222dd06ae9c5fefa05b91054d97","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Steam","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1157709260214521938","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1158709885341532313","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"What you are saying is correct but also partially related to self-understanding.

You've correctly observed many of the characteristics of yourself, but the biggest piece is seeing how our imagination and self-image is fundamentally the effort to navigate the past and future and interlink it with the present.

Just to narrow it down a bit more, are there any specifics people are more or less interested in? I know it's annoying to put your own suggestion out there, so I'll throw some examples, feel free to throw out literally anything. From my own experience I feel explaining a bit of Ramana Maharshi's views would be helpful as I remember thinking \"damn this guy is definitely in some unusual mental space but wtf is he saying\", while I also look at something like the Tae Te Ching as very profound but also very boring, even though they are both really saying the same thing. In the same vein, I think that the practical conversations situation might be a bit lackluster because I don't have any grand wisdom to tell anyone how they should actually do something, but there is a good understanding of why people do what they already do; how anxiety/anger/hopelessness/thinking/etc. operate and the outcomes they demand and why we do certain things in relationship to those emotions. To give an example, I have literally no idea how someone else should improve a relationship or make a career move, but I feel very comfortable expressing why there is attachment in relationship, certain worries/fear of them leaving, etc. or why there is discontent in daily behaviours and your own job in relationship to your own desires.","timestamp":"2023-09-22T07:43:31.708000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":true,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1154662824568705084","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You don't need to figure out how it got there or that kind of thing.

If they are expressing despair, hopelessness, or regret I would say sympathy, if it is anger, pride, or self-comparison it is more like frustration. Neither is an emotion but are related to lack of mutual communication in some form. Sympathy is more the want to help someone through communicating something they are missing to help them, while there is frustration in communication with others when they express express irrational and distorted communication that you can tell is harming them or others and you want to be in communication with them so they stop doing that. Communication fundamentally being complete mutual understanding. If they are happy and not actively expressing an emotion that is hurting them then that is great and is our natural state anyway. So while there is a desire for others to have the same self-realization so they can be happy and peaceful basically all the time, you don't actively view others as \"realized vs. not-realized\" but rather in a constant game of emotional peekaboo throughout the day. When someone's beliefs are harmed or their self-image is active in conversation it is sort of seen like \"oh they're having a dream right now\" and the sympathy or frustration is wanting them to snap out of it, but then when they're happy again it's like they're back to their actual selves.","timestamp":"2023-09-22T02:41:06.565000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-22T02:51:20.037000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1154465857297203201","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1154604372412600411","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I see what you're saying, I guess my perspective is that self-image is a physical structure and electrical pattern in the brain, it isn't something that is negated through idealism or an attitude or \"approach to life\".  The physical cessation of this structure is what self-realization is, and is analogous to deleting the sd card when you realized you already transferred the files to the hard drive. It is likely the part of your brain meant for creating easy to access reconfigurations of your own memory to understand others being accidentally used on ourselves from a very young age when we learn about \"Me\" and first conceptualize that in thought. Our self-image itself is the emotional relationship to thought and the imagination of ourselves. The entire phenomenon I'm pointing to is that ending as it's not needed and we accidentally create it for ourselves through misunderstanding and a false belief of what we are. As a small example, while it would of course be more helpful to someone who suffers chronic anxiety to be rid of it, it is the cessation of anxiety entirely, as anxiety is not necessary at all and created by the belief we can imagine ourselves. The same with anger at thought, envy, jealousy, comparison, regret, longing, etc. The reason I think it is so important is because the emotional components are more or less a byproduct, the actual realization is realizing what you are as a life form and what life itself is that you are and are experiencing. Which is literally the most primordial and important question you can answer because it is the only thing you experience from birth to death. It is just the resolution to the question \"I exist, what am I?\". While I remember not looking myself before, at least now it is almost puzzling to see nearly every person on earth constantly, every moment of the day *trying to do something* not stopping for a second to sort of question what they are experiencing what's been going on their whole life in the first place.","timestamp":"2023-09-22T02:25:33.895000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1154450902405627984","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1154599954392813598","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's not that you don't use memory or can't think/choose in the practical sense.

The only thing I would really say in response and to add on is that I think a lot of what you're saying is relatable and makes a lot of sense. To contextualize self-realization with regards to self-image and our conventional experience of life it is fundamentally a return to simplicity through resolving all the complexities we experience in thought. Our whole lives we seek resolution to problems through incremental improvement, goal seeking, measurement, and \"I'm this level, but I could be at *this* level\", etc. Physically that is possible and enjoyable, but mentally it isn't. \n\nTo maybe relate, in the past I tried to resolve my own psychological struggles through rationalization, intellectualization, and idealism. I thought \"well, if I just eat right, look right, act right, I'll be happier\", \"well, if I just achieve the things I know I'm capable of then I'll be happy\", \"well there are obvious incremental improvements I could execute to make my life better\", etc, etc. The error in this entire line of thinking is not realizing that what we are navigating is the compendium of our beliefs and thoughts, not the actual objects that we think thought represents. As an example that I mentioned before, my Uncle often contemplates and shares his new discoveries on what he thinks reality and the universe is, but what he is actually examining are the thoughts that pop into his brain that he then mistakes for physical objects that exist in reality. \"the word is not the thing, the symbol is not the objects, etc.\".

Neither is necessarily good or bad, the point is to observe that our emotional self-judgment is based on our beliefs about who who think we are, have been, will be, and should be, etc.","timestamp":"2023-09-21T07:38:06.827000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-21T07:41:00.909000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"562311924633698315","username":"nkkip","avatar":"a5a874d685985a19d18cc5831d91510c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Timon","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1154080147624972338","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1154194659342565376","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Oh sorry I will write something more coherent, I think my response got cut off and came out wrong when I was in the process of copy pasting it to format on Discord","timestamp":"2023-09-20T23:17:30.687000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-20T23:18:45.248000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1154107217956569170","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1154034472895914135","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yes, exactly, that.

You can try, and there is no problem if you want to, but what you are understanding in imaginaton isn't the problem, you are understanding the nature of your own thought. I had a conversation with a family member in recent retirement who has been obsessing for the last 5 years with finding the material explanation of reality. That's cool and I learn a lot from him, but he does that because he's not content. He thinks he will find something he doesn't currently have that will bring him comfort and peace in his current life, he's expressed this himself as, parapharsing, \"If I knew what everything was, then I know what to expect, of course that's what I'm doing. What else is there to worry about?\". \n\nThe only point I want to make in relationship is that what I want to convey to others is that we spend our entire lives trying to navigate our relationship with thought because we think it points to \"My life, the past, the future, the everything\". When in reality our actual life, as it is only is, it is at arm's reach. I wish I could tell my family member that he isn't contemplating the universe, he is contemplating his own human thoughts he calls \"the universe\" but it is just one idea. No one can contemplate the universe, you can only have a thought and mistakenly call that thought anything you want.

We all enjoy that nothing to diss about that. Thinking about things and intellectual scrutiny also good depending on the time, place, person, and circumstance. Psychedelics, I have a lot of opinions, because my view is that psychedlics and their implications on conscious experience can be resolved if there isn't self-image, as self-image is emotional relationship to thought, and emotional relationship to thought leads to almost all dreams. My view is that psychedelics are fundamentally \"dreaming while you're awake\" along with emotional experiences of love or despair for other reasons if that might take place. I think dreams, psychedelics, and how that goes on might be its own conversation. I really just wanted to chime in as an adjacent perspective and where I'm coming from. Not a direct response, but taking some pieces from what you're saying and I'm not completely replying directly, but have some related personal experience that might be loosely helpful.\n\nI think the biggest thing I got from the last couple of comments you made is what I think is a really intelligent effort to understand our self-image. We want to take our entire experience, and especially if we are capable and intelligent, we try to \"figure it out\". This automatically results in the pursuit of ideals, but the rejection of ideology and the pursuit of \"the perfect me\" whether that is objectively superior for some people or \"the meaning of life\" for others, or \"finding happiness\" etc.","timestamp":"2023-09-20T10:16:53.932000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-20T13:02:55.583000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"718191919397863536","username":"lethaeon","avatar":"0ccdb087a6c016254d3417038d828828","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jyby","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b537dd607dcd467f778f3ab352e26856","sku_id":"1461062060120080384","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1428438925067817093","asset":"nameplates/plastic/ryomen_sukuna/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_PLASTIC_RYOMEN_SUKUNA_NP_A11Y","palette":"crimson"}},"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"89778537522802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"CMDR","badge":"7b006ea85b2188f12f76423fd9d6f2ae"}},{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1153124122163949629","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1153990279020429384","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I thought about this basic and kind of cliché analogy earlier today, but I think it applies. The \"mental illness\" in a mild sense, or our \"self-image\" that I talk about is basically walking through a garden of 10,000 flowers and saying \"what is the perfect flower?\" or \"what is the worst flower?\" or \"what is xyz flower?\" and then not just constantly being frustrated through comparing thought to experience, but then the invention of all of our beliefs take place, which is for example saying \"fuck these harmful flowers\", \"praise these unsuccessful but helpful flowers\", \"hooray for these beautiful, supportive flowers\", and \"fuck these successful but unappreciated flowers\". Then there is the annoyance at the gardener who isn't fertilizing the flowers correctly, and the other people who walk through the garden and don't see it the way you do, etc. \n\nIn the analogy, self-realization is just walking through the garden and seeing the garden exactly as you see it. Some ugly flowers, some nice, some good gardening, some bad, but there it is, no ideals, no failures, just the fact. Seeing all life and humanity like this is the resulting state of mind, and the effort of meditation and conscious effort is to understand why the only thing there is, is what *is*. The fight ends and there is just observation of the fact. While you have your own complete participation, the automatic perspective is that self-realization is seeing everything is already perfect, and it is always becoming more so.

If you are a certain religion, you will be totally fine until someone contradicts that. The problem is that the deeper belief is in \"Who I am\" which causes near constant emotional relationship to both internal and external thoughts about our physical and mental characteristics. In a deeper way, \"my life isn't what it should be\" or \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'm better than everyone\" is a belief that is so pervasive it is nearly constantly active and what creates obvious \"mental illness\" that most of us observe and study.\n\nMy personal view is that the way that most of us describe mental illness, yes, nearly all people are mentally ill, but from my perspective everyone is acting and emotionally reactive to things in their own experience perfectly rationally. There are people who have physical damage to the brain or nervous system that causes suffering to themselves and others and that is real illness. But 99% of people are sane, and they are always acting \"correctly\" as it occurs to them, despite operating on faulty scaffolding they've built and the role that their consciousness plays but hasn't escaped.

The moment that peace ends is when our self-image returns, which is our thoughts about our thoughts.

Maybe it is this topic, maybe it is politics, parents, relationships, friends, job, whatever.

The question of \"what am I?\". \nWhat I'm describing is the cessation of emotional suffering, but if you're experiencing something lame in your life, it won't fix that. You are still responsible for resolving your own material life according to your own preferences and abilities. Your emotions can change, and if you want to lean into this, then that might be helpful, if you want to lean into something else, then lean into that. Just add it to your branch of thoughts. The realization is automatic and requires no effort, but it isn't something that you \"level up\" in. An example would be I remember being a 4 year old kid and being scared that I would never learn to tie my shoes. It just seemed too complicated for me to comprehend. Same thing with navigating an airport as I did that a fair bit when I was kid because my parents lived apart. Nowadays I can definitely tie my shoes and airports are so tedious and inefficient it is physically annoying. What changed? We are used to trying to \"solve\" our problems, but self-realization is partially about the recognition of the automatic and constant change in our lives that we don't actively pursue. A 5 year old is frightened of catching a plane, a 30 year old is pissed off by it. Recognizing your life automatically changes over time according to your nature is partially related to what I'm describing. I don't like referencing people because I appreciate them more than anything, but if you take Sam Harris' views as an example, he largely has similar \"intellectual\" views as me, but he isn't saying the same thing. The main reason is because he views the problem of \"not knowing how to tie my shoes\" as a problem he is trying to solve. He now has a very elaborate and complex rationalization of shoe tying, when self-realization is actually seeing that your ability to tie your shoes is part of the development of the human being you are, not an intellectual achievement you now possess.","timestamp":"2023-09-15T09:10:29.895000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-15T09:53:31.133000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"710001930654449664","username":"smorto","avatar":"a_2578ee9c37b5e2545c410645128d322c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"soi","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b4dcf63b6af2e20cba91af61c0e3a8a7","sku_id":"1333866045261480007","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1349849614286585866","asset":"nameplates/nameplates/cityscape/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_CITYSCAPE_A11Y","palette":"violet"}},"display_name_styles":{"font_id":8,"effect_id":3,"colors":[16725190]},"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1151365214512619570","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1152166722216931430","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"*quantum*","timestamp":"2023-09-15T08:59:12.799000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"246833676942311424","username":"babybaccribs","avatar":"25b37dd979ab0a7704837122ac86316e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"baby bacc ribs","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1151345020130054214","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1152166651383521353","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just to add to this quote, the entirety of self-realizaiton, both conceptually and physiologically, is the realization that all experience you will ever have as a human being occurs to you right now.

In that they either have very strong intellectual views that can't be broken, or they are so loose that they are just going to believe whatever an authority figure tells them. Getting a person in the middle who genuinely is asking \"I don't know if what you're saying is valuable, but I'll shake you down and see if there's something valuable to me\" is very rare but exactly who is going to get somewhere, even if they might experience two steps forward and one step back type of thing repeatedly. The person has to actually have the individual want to solve the problem of \"Me\". If that isn't there nothing will ever happen because they aren't aiming at the solution. The hardest thing is to instill a sense of \"you don't know what you are at all, start with that\". A common thread I see on Discord, and I've very happy to see it because people are really looking in the right place, but it is a misunderstanding, is the belief that our self-image is \"my opinion about myself\". That is how it's commonly used in everyday speech, but our self-image is much, much, larger, like an iceberg. When other people intellectually understand the language around self-realization, but haven't experience it themselves, it is usually because they have boxed their self-image into a very specific corner, and said \"there is little more I can understand about that, my imagined self\". That's great, but they don't recognize that is about 20% of their self-image. Most people think that self-image is specifically their thoughts about their physical body, behaviour, or action, but it is nearly 95% of all thought that has any relationship to experience.","timestamp":"2023-09-15T08:51:50.993000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-15T09:50:35.692000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1152164843856601158","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I won't speak to other people's understanding or experience, but I think the difference between intellectual understanding and a personal change in subjective experience is largely the direction of your own personal intelligence towards a specific goal.

Furthermore, the entity \"my past and future\" exists in your present as \"what I'm thinking\". There is absolutely no experience of \"past and future\" other than thought.

What I'm communicating is really very simple even though it might sometimes come off as philosophical or complicated. All emotions in my view are signals of the nervous system, all thoughts are too. I think we are in agreement on that. What I'm trying to communicate is that if there is an understanding of what \"Me\" is that has existence and lives our life out, then there is automatic physiological change in how our senses are experienced in relationship to thought.

Love is an amazing emotion that I really like, sex is pleasurable, and good food tastes good and bad food taste bad. If there is a desire to debate our thought based interpretation of these signals then it's not really something I want to participate in because I think they are all intuitive. If we go down the route of re-interpreting our emotions through philosophy, for example saying \"instead of interpreting anxiety as bad, David Goggins has taught me how to see it as good!\" that in my view is a form of coping. If you really welcomed anxiety it would be excitement, because that is positive expectation and uncertainty. All that I'm just saying \"I experienced anxiety nearly all the time, it wasn't pleasant.

If you understand completely yourself, then the mild change in mental processing has a corresponding relationship to what \"everything else\" is related to our conventional understanding of reality™ . You don't know any new information, but for example the conventional academic view is scientific materialism, which the unfolding of energy, matter, and physical laws over time, and that this physical \"map\" or \"landscape\" is separate from \"Me\", resulting in the view that there is \"Me\" and \"The World\" and \"I am acting in the world\". This is the duality, and non-duality isn't the belief \"I am part of the universe so it is all one!\" It is the change in subjective experience at observing that you have no material characteristics at all, and the human being you are acting out is part of reality, just like all other material phenomenon. In the sense that if there is the genuine recognition that all sensory experience is automatic, not in the hard-determinism sense, but automatic in the \"if my eyes are open, I see whatever's there\" type of way, then absolutely all sensory experience is a product of material reality, including our human body and all that we ever experience. Non-duality really has no teaching relationship I currently see to self-understanding and why I don't like referencing it much.","timestamp":"2023-09-09T11:22:58.142000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1150027020831576164","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Not exactly sure what you mean directly in response to the quote you replied to me with, but in response to the second part I wanted to say I don't exactly have the same view as Revin, in that we often view our lives as a long chain of thoughts and belief because we haven't understood thought.

I think a commonly expressed belief in modern spiritual circles or the \"mindfulness\" trend is to \"stay in that place!\", which is why there is constant effort and no one in those groups ever gets anywhere. If you try to keep your mind \"empty\" or \"silence your thoughts\" you are concentrating, nothing more significant than that. If you try to \"stop yourself from thinking\" but you yourself are partially thought, it is like trying to slap yourself in the face and telling yourself \"don't feel pain\". If you ask a monk why they're meditating, they'd say \"to achieve enlightenment\" but if you ask Buddha why he's meditating he'd say \"oh, it's warm out, I'm just chillin'\". The \"emptiness\" or \"silence\" that is being searched for just has to be recognized as what is always there that these thoughts and experiences are occurring to/within or even \"are\". That is what \"Me\" is; \"I am what I am currently experiencing\", but again the description isn't the actual experiencing, just what you will recognize if you observe it personally. \n\nSelf-realization is not a state you have not yet achieved, it is the recognition of what you yourself are that happens to coincide with a change in state automatically. If you pursue a change in state, that is just our self-image, but if you pursue self-understanding, the immediate realization of what that is results in emotional change.","timestamp":"2023-09-09T10:56:12.470000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1137147889123074099","username":"anakinslywalker","avatar":"811743dcca2958cab6aa21b1a1675786","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Fillmore","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1149727867895292105","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1150016797089738842","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just in response to reading a book for example, all reading is a form of thought, and in the case of fiction if you read the words and imagine a story it is essentially a light form of daydreaming.

You don't experience anything emotionally reading fiction, but you do experience beauty at the art form and story.

This isn't an insult, it is what I used to try to do. But if there is an understanding of what \"Me\" is, then this second set of emotions related to imagination ends, and you only experience the base emotions when necessary, which in modern society means basically never experiencing any negative emotion except shame, as others have self-images that might get hurt and they communicate that to you, but love can far more easily be experienced. \n\nI really, fully reject the \"it's just brain signals we create judgment around\". Anxiety was unpleasant, excitement is pleasant. Both are intense emotions because of the uncertainty and are \"hot\" in experience. You want them to be resolved quickly. One is uncertainty + positive expectation and one is uncertainty + negative expectation. Pain is an electric signal in the brain but we all hate it. Guilt and shame are the same. Despair in relationship to self-image is miserable and debilitating. Self-realization really has nothing to do with the negation of emotions or \"ignoring them\" or \"learning to be non-judgmental\" like a lot of modern meditation seems to try to centre around and \"improve\" like mental bodybuilding, that's all a bit goofy, it is a mild physiological change in the brain from an understanding of your own nature that causes all irrational emotion to end, which is all emotion not related to immediate physical perception.","timestamp":"2023-09-09T10:16:27.745000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-09T10:21:23.867000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1150011830123638864","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I don't agree with this view as it largely relegates emotions to vestigial byproducts of evolution or as seemingly random occurrences we create association with in thought and memory. The difficulty in explaining emotions and why we have so much difficulty understanding them is because we experience two sets of emotions that overlap with each other and create complex emotions that aren't instinctual to us. One set of emotions related to immediate perception, and one set of emotions in relationship to our beliefs, thoughts, and imagination about what is occurring to us. For example, all of the emotions that I experience are anger, shame, despair, fear, and love. If your self-image concludes, you basically never experience any emotion because these emotions all mean specific things. Fear is the perception there is immediate, physical danger (a bear for example), despair is the incapacity to experience love (you are horribly disfigured in an accident and can no longer can or wish to act out your life), shame is when another person communicates to you in some way you have hurt them, and anger allows you to hurt another organism to protect an innocent person without feeling shame. Love is complete communication with another, almost always a romantic partner, and is the \"two brain cells in a pod\" phenomenon, but can occur at a lower intensity with non-romantic partners you feel a connection or peer relationship with.

I'm not sure if you've seen the video I made on Jamie's channel, but one of the main things I wanted to emphasize is that self-realization is not philosophical, knowledge, action, or any form of effort for control, it is a strictly a physiological phenomenon that results in the immediate and permanent change in mental processing in a certain way. The inquiry that has historically been used is the question \"what am I?\", but not in the modern academic, knowledge based inquiry of \"what characteristics can I call myself and what is the statistical validity of these categorizations\" but the more primordial inquiry into your own existence. Not \"where did I come from, where do I go?\" like in religion, not \"what do I know about myself?\" like in philosophy, but that you exist and to observe directly what that is. If the actual fact of what you currently are and always have been as a life form with your own consciousness is understood directly, this phenomenon occurs, as it instantly unravels our self-image, which is the constant effort to use thought to understand our self-concept. Historically it was the purpose of meditation, but like many things it has become distorted significantly and misinterpreted as a practice, skill, or achievement.\n\nIn regards to your specific example, I am suggesting that it is not important that you try to argue with your anxiety and say \"that anxiety wasn't necessary\". If you knew, genuinely, that it wasn't necessary it wouldn't arise. Go into anxiety and question what anxiety itself is. Why do you experience anxiety? Not what are the evolutionary rationalizations of anxiety you might have learned, but directly, in yourself, what is it? You experience anxiety because you believe there might be an outcome that might hurt your imagined self. Self-realization is the physiological cessation of this relationsihp to our imagined-self and occurs automatically at the recognition of what your existence is.","timestamp":"2023-09-09T09:59:17.158000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"327567635191562244","username":"venguis","avatar":"e2e13e97360dd358aa6f547079d36e28","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Venguis","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1149347460553125918","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1150003967460380746","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"For myself personally there is no emotional relationship to achievement, what I would have described previously as goals or achievements you still pursue and want to accomplish, but only because it is like pursuing something beautiful rather than ugly.

Basically you try to externally express yourself according to your internal, natural order. This is how you come up with goals like running a marathon in the first place. I personally have no interest in running marathons, but I might make a goal in regards to weightlifting or expanding my youtube content. Any of our goals are just thought based expressions of our internal nature, the emotions attached to the goals themselves are unnecessary as they relate to our beliefs about ourselves and distort our behaviour and capacity to set proper goals and execute them. Small example, but if there is no self-image the highest emotional state is love.

The self-image I am describing is a deeper issue than just having nightmares and rejecting their irrationality, it is seeing the fundamental causative link that creates nightmares in the first place, and its resolution stops all nightmares and waking neuroticism, as they are both the same thing.","timestamp":"2023-09-07T12:12:59.378000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"122335534235385858","username":"blackwidowsc","avatar":"433831867fac39b26ac5efb8aeec0db7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Blackwidow","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1149295430048415754","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1149313215872909343","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Have you watched the video I made on Jamie's channel and could maybe share your thoughts?

The reason you experience anger in relationship to self-image is because you perceive in your imagination another person or entity is harming someone else and/or yourself. This is what creates conflictual emotional relationship to politics, religion, economics, relationships, and all beliefs. You believe you are right, and that the other person is to some degree not considering or understanding your viewpoint and that it would change their opinion to be less harmful if they did. The anger is the desire to protect others by stopping a harmful person/entity.\n\nThe reason this is irrational is because it's like a sunflower being mad at a zucchini. There is the lack of recognition of your own viewpoint that is entirely shaped by your own experience and subjective experience. Not that you might be right about more things than them, but if you've had your brain, your experiences, your upbringing, and everything exactly the way you have experienced it, of course you would believe what you do. If you lived their life exactly as it was you would believe what they do. An example of this in the US is that nearly no Democrats have a clue why someone would vote Republican and no Republicans have a clue why people vote democrat. They both vote from their own perspective and everything seems completely obvious because they don't have knowledge of any other type of lifestyle or belief.","timestamp":"2023-09-07T11:31:14.085000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"530280332616794112","username":"jefflemaker","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jeff","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1148779062425288775","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1149301576855466064","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Every emotion has utility, but there are certainly \"good and bad emotions\".

What we describe as \"mental illness\" in the common sense is entirely \"bad emotions\", and I don't think anyone would say to someone who was depressed that their state was neither good nor bad. They are misesrable and unhappy. While what I'm communicating has historically been described as, and in my view is \"the end of suffering\", that doesn't mean \"the absence of bad emotions means only good emotion\". It means you stop experiencing nearly any emotions at all and realize that 99% of your life has nothing to do with emotions in the first place. It is the emotional relationship to imaginary experiences, dreams, and nigthmares that is causing nearly all of it and preventing you from being aware of what your life is at all. You genuinely don't need emotions other than to prevent you from dying, hurting others, to protect others, and then the only one left is the pursuit of love, which is the complete expression of your nature and communication with others.","timestamp":"2023-09-07T11:14:08.913000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1149301574733140058","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The modern and educated misunderstanding is that \"everything is thought\", and that emotions are often redundant vestigial experiences. This is completely false. Thought and belief are clumsy and new, emotions are rock solid and perfectly refined. A question to ask yourself from the viewpoint of \"there are better or worse outcomes\" is straightforwardly, \"what is the best possible outcome for yourself, all the time?\" Imagine your life was perfect, all the time. What would that look like and what emotions would you experience then? If emotions are neutral, but there are better or worse outcomes, there must be absolute certainty in thought, which is coming up with those outcomes. If you are valuing the perfect thought, what is it? What is the perfect thought? The only way to reduce \"perfect thought\" is to accept reality exactly as it is, which eliminates thought from desire entirely. Not that thought isn't necessary, but that it truthfully has no relationship to emotion. This has to be realized, not believed. \n\nEmotions without a self-image operating act similarly to dashboard indicators, as they cause exceptions to usual behaviour. In the circumstance of physical danger for example, anger can occurr to allow you to hurt another living organism without experiencing shame afterwards, as it occurs when you or a protected other is wrongfully threatened.","timestamp":"2023-09-07T11:14:08.407000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1149301540784443442","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"If you examine your own anxiety, you will notice that it only occurs in relationship to thought. Fear occurs when there is physical danger: someone threatening you, an out of control fire, an earthquake, a high ledge, but anxiety occurs exclusively in relationship to an imagined outcome.

We are frightened of going to a party or doing a presentation because we are frightened we will look a fool and people will treat us worse.

When we are experiencing emotional love, we want to remain there and no action is necessary. If we are in that state, no action is necessary, all we ever notice is when the emotion is leaving or has left us. In contrast, when we are angry we want to hurt others to fulfill our anger, when we are anxious we want to avoid the source of anxiety, when we are ashamed we want to make things right with the person we've wronged.

If there is nothing else more important to do you will do it right away because it is more enjoyable than doing nothing. If it gets too messy or unclean, then you can also reach a point you say \"this is unacceptably disorderly\" and then it takes priority over other tasks. If you have someone coming over the next day it is more important and so you will clean your place. It is analogous to observing when you do a university essay, you leave it until the last minute and then start it with 7 hours to midnight and it takes you exactly 6 hours 55.

You can't change your emotions and you can't fight your thoughts. The only thing to do is understand completely what they/you are and then change is automatic. I'm not saying there are two categories of thought; one desired action based on intuition and moment-to-moment behaviour, and another category related to self-image that creates emotion that can be contemplated and ignored towards a hypothetical benefit. In the example's you've discussed, all the motivations you've describe are a result of self-image as they're born from the desire for right action and behaviour, which is based on your beliefs of what is right/wrong/optimal/efficient/desirable and is your self-image. When you say \"I want to appear as a clean person\" or \"I want a more pleasant environment\" they are both thoughts. These aren't two different categories, they are two thoughts that can both be rationales for certain behaviour. All that matters is if an emotion arises with those thoughts, and then there can be inquiry into the beliefs you yourself have that causes that neurotic relationship. If for example, you are concerned with others judging you on being \"clean and organized\" then you will have a strong emotional relationship to maintaining that image, whereas if you didn't care about that, and instead wanted to be hyper-productive 14 hours a day so you can achieve your goals you might not care what others think of you, but be very neurotic about how your work environment is perfect enough to be conducive to you operating at 105%.

There's nothing wrong with this, it is the uncomfortable emotional relationship to this outcome that causes us problems in our life, and our desire for certain outcomes to resolve our emotional distress also causes us to create harmful goals. Obvious example is \"I have to be a Doctor/engineer/lawyer or I'll disappoint my parents\" which corresponds primarily with anxiety and guilt. \"I want her/him to like me\" causes anxiety at failure, and even ambition itself is also uncomfortable as it's the belief you are currently insufficient and results in restlessness and near constant dissatisfaction. The certainty we have in a unilateral and obvious goal \"I just need to do this and I will be rich/hot/successful\", etc. creates gullibility and error in judgment as well as discomfort and \"not moving fast enough\". I don't think it is possible nor necessary to restrain our emotions in anyway, they change or end automatically in relationship to our beliefs and understanding of ourselves and what we are doing moment to moment and day to day. If you are using knowledge to create goals then you will be emotionally attached to \"better and worse outcomes\" and emotionally react to that. What I'm pointing to is the self-undertanding that ends emotional-relationship to thought. There isn't drive to do anything unless there is danger or love (other than hunger/pain, etc.), but the motivation for \"personal growth\" is really the movement from disorganization to \"just right\" which is personal and changing all the time.

As human beings we work in exactly the same way. All thinking about the future is just \"My best guess based on the my current knowledge\" it has no relationship to the actual future, which doesn't exist, it only has relationship to our present understanding and memory. Nothing you imagine ever happens to you. You have never in your life nor ever will be hurt by a thought or a dream. If you dream that you are shot by someone, you wake up and are completely fine. If you then get shot by someone in real life, that hurts a lot, but the dream has nothing at all to do with it.

It is trying to express compassion as well, but that love and compassion isn't for others, it is for your imagined self that you believe has a certain past and might have a certain future, which is then perceived essentially as \"another person\" that we try to act compassionately towards. If someone suffers from depression, anxiety, or even ambition, it might be insightful to recontextualize the experience from \"my life is so bad everything is hopeless\" and \"oh god what if I mess this up or xyz happens\" to \"I love and care for myself so much I want everything to be exactly what would be the best for me\". While I think it might be a bit counterintuitive, it allows a different approach to be taken that isn't just raw, incremental self-improvement through \"fixing everything wrong\" or the ripping the whole tree up type of thing we talk about here, which is it allows you to outline exactly what it is you think your life should be, which it currently isn't, then you can not only more accurately see what you can plausibly physically accomplish, but you can also see what you think would be the best for you and you can consciously acknowledge what you are not capable or physically able to accomplish once you've laid out what you really want. This allows a different means of dealing with attachment to a certain belief about yourself, which is effectively \"letting it go\" and results in grieving, which might be uncomfortable, but it finally allows you to actually rebuild new, more practical beliefs about yourself that you can actually carry out and accomplish in your life, which I think is the most helpful for lust experienced from breakups or hopelessness from a past loved one, which both are generally things you can't \"get back\" but we have attachment to emotionally.

While we conventionally address this by trying to physically \"fix\" our life, or try to overcome our individual beliefs by changing them to something less dire, which both work as forms of coping or self-improvement and do \"improve\" your emotional state,  I think it can be valuable to know that what your self-image fundamentally is is a duplication of your emotions that don't act in response to immediate circumstance, but instead act upon thought and imagination or what we believe is \"the past or future\". This isn't that important to know itself, and it isn't obvious to us, but it does lead to an insight that might be valuable, which is that there are multiple negative emotions that mean different things, but the only positive emotion largely speaking is love/compassion, which is meant for helping others and making their lives better, which when communicated back to you is the emotion itself and it feels really good.","timestamp":"2023-09-03T02:50:54.721000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-03T02:52:06.189000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1137147889123074099","username":"anakinslywalker","avatar":"811743dcca2958cab6aa21b1a1675786","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Fillmore","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1147685052008902737","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1147698649850200175","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"There is nothing wrong with having a belief if it's analogous to an opinion or \"what I think about this\", when I use the word \"belief\" I really mean any thought or pattern of thought that you have emotional relationship to.

You are just what you are individually with no caveats. You have no control over your own nature, but you are aware and responsible for your own actions. The acorn is the oak, the orange seed is the orange tree, etc.Your life from birth to death isn't a series of objectives, milestones or goals, it is the external manifestation of your personality and nature. Just like how some dogs are not so smart and other breeds are really smart, some people are short/tall/smart/dumb, and everyone's personality is different. How that nature plays itself out over ~80 years is what you are experiencing as \"Me\", you aren't a third party entity making decisions and controlling everything autonomously. You can't decide to become something you aren't already, as whatever you decide to do or think is being created by what you currently are. Your current physiology is creating the thought you are experiencing. \n\nLife still unfolds with uncertainty, but there is no resistance to your life as it is. There is no experience of past or future, but you can still think and plan future present actions and think about your memory of past events. You never experience the past or future anyway, but the belief we can think about and interact with it creates the desire for change and restlessness/regret.\n\nStill, a little bit further, there is still no standalone entity at all called \"Me\", other than the experience you/me/we are aware of. If there is no experience you are aware of, there is no \"Me\". You are in deep sleep, black-out drunk, or not alive. When there is no experience or memory you only resume being yourself at the next moment in time you have sensory experience again.

If we remember when we called the teacher \"Mom\" in 3rd grade, we feel emotional embarrassment because we say \"that was me being cringeworthy\" . Because we believe the object in thought called \"past me\" is actually us, there is emotional relationship because we are having an experience of us doing something socially harmful. The belief that our life consists of \"past me, present me, and future me\" is what creates continual emotional relationship to imagination. When someone thinks of something that might hurt them in the future, there is emotional reaction to that because they think it might actually happen. \n\nImagine we look at a weather report. A weather report only acts upon present climatic circumstance, it can't go into the future, it just takes present circumstances and extrapolates them. Lets say the weather report says \"in a week, there is going to be a category 5 hurricane\". Someone might be emotionally distraught by that, but then a week later the report says \"oh, our bad, no hurricane, just 10 m/ph wind\". And the person who was panicking for a week would say \"bro what the fuck!! I've been stressing the last week!\". What I'm pointing to is that it is not possible to know if the weather report is right or wrong as it is being made. You might trust it or you might not, but all emotional relationship to it uncessary because it is just the assertion of particular knowledge. It might be right, it might be wrong, you might trust it, you might not, emotional anxiety or anger is useless in this circumstance and so doesn't need to arise. That's really all that it is. The weather report analogy is how thought works. Thought believes it can abstract reality and go into the past or future, but it can't. Emotional relationship to thought is only necessary because we believe we can imagine something that isn't currently occurring to us, which isn't possible.","timestamp":"2023-08-27T08:23:15.594000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-27T08:25:06.302000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"775834763793268766","username":"phantom0z","avatar":"9c553279dcf59a340c698f68df8d6e74","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"phantom0z","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1145263663465365516","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1145247246082920509","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The biggest part is seeing that thought and knowledge is part of human experience, it can't go outside of it and think about it.

This is the first time it is direct person to person communication with the internet.

Is J.K. going to talk about how self-realizaiton relates to cell phones and social media? No, because it didn't exist to him. Every person who speaks on the concept is doing so from their own memory and experience.

The recognition that you are a unitary whole with no contradiction is the phenomenon. Perhaps in the equational sense, and please forgive my terrible math, I'm just trying to use the same language, it might be more helpful to say that absolutely any equation you can think of, the role of \"Me\" is the = sign. In our own lives we try to equilibrate our biological and physiological chemistry with the \"external\" world in a sort of \"Me + change = The World I want\" type of thing, but self-realization is realizing you are the equals sign. If you realize you are the equals sign, then you aren't the \"Me + Change\", it is instead \"Change = The World I want\". If you are the equals sign you have to also subtract the \"I\" part, meaning you get \"Change = The World\", meaning roughly that if change and world are the same, and the equals sign is us, what our awareness is is fundamentally Δworld. What we are is the awareness of the worlds material change, and that is something that is always present and ever occurring. This is what non-duality is. That your human body and the world are both \"the world\", you are just aware of that interaction. Again, using terribly inaccurate math to represent this, but thematically this is correct.

Each of us obviously exists and has some qualitative form that is different from someone else. I can move my arms and have my thoughts, you can move your arms and have your thoughts. There is a \"Me\". The difficulty is that the assertion \"there is no 'me'\" is related to the idea that there is no self-image, because most of us believe we are our thoughts about ourselves. The notion \"you can't think about yourself\" can be validated in thought, and results in the belief \"the self is an illusion\", but that is only part of the story. The actual cessation of the illusory \"self\" is self-realization, not addressing or concluding part of you is false. J.K. expresses what the self is as \"The observer is the observed\" or \"the thinker is the thought\". Ramana describes it as \"Satcitananda\" or Brahman. Eckart Tolle describes it as the experience of the present moment. New age guys like Rupert Spira describe it as \"The modulation of the screen of consciousness\". I would personally just describe it using the negative, which is as the cessation of an imagined self. For there to be no imagined-self, you must realize what the real self is, but if there is absolutely no self-imagination, there is only the present, only the modulation of the screen, only the thought/experience, only Brahman, etc. I am absolutely, completely certain what \"Me\" is, but it only occurs when observe the falsity of whatever you currently believe \"Me\" is. \n\nIn brief, thinking stops operating when it finds an answer. If someone poses a question like \"2 + 2\" you might have to first think about numbers, then think about addition, then finally when you get, suddenly you say \"ah, it's 4\" and then thinking stops. The concept of \"What am I?\" is exactly the same. When you get it, thinking about yourself stops.","timestamp":"2023-08-25T05:52:48.784000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-25T05:52:59.722000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1144361347115659364","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1144506829989220362","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Well, great question because a very important observation is whether there is a difference between \"me trying to answer a question\" and \"whatever thought pops up in my mind\".","timestamp":"2023-08-25T05:41:32.178000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"583704996919509002","username":"alfordarthur","avatar":"69a2e4b8d96c9607c3a3b677371988ea","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Al-Ford Arthur","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1144349896921591828","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1144506278014636053","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"They are saying that \"Red\" is a unique actuality separate from \"Blue\".

Knowledge is perceived as hierarchical for the same reason we think bachelors, masters, and PhD is incremental and \"knowledge based\" but any thought a professor has is just one thought at a time and not related to past experience. It is necessary to have past experience to get there, but the thought itself stands alone. When a heavyweight boxer throws a punch, they aren't throwing 20 years of experience into the punch, they are just throwing the punch they are currently capable of throwing. What I'm trying to point to is that the way thinking operates is exactly what you are currently physiologically capable of thinking. The next thought you think is exactly the same, and the next thought exactly the same. There is no hierarchy, just \"what I'm currently thinking\".

We relate one thought to another thought and create relationship like an index or hierarchy that helps us evaluate our actions or behaviour. We say \"I'm using my knowledge here\" but all that is happening is we are using our current thought like a max level snowball that has been built up. There isn't a massive stockpile of information we are parsing and unloading, there is only gradual refinement of present experience that is now capable of more nuanced and helpful thought. Knowledge acquisition is in large part \"the capacity to throw away unnecessary thoughts\" rather than entirely being \"accumulating a databank of information\". Not completely accurate, but just as a theme. Similar to how Messi doesn't \"know a lot more about football/soccer\" his current form is the accumulation and refinement of all experience he has had. He might have never thought about soccer theory at all, but if you ask him a question, he might have a very \"high level\" answer, because his brain is so refined and tuned in to his level of expertise.

Thinking is essentially \"observing in consciousness the current content/configuration of certain brain cells\". Our natural intuition that \"I'm the one thinking, I'm the one doing the learning, I'm the one figuring this out\" causes us a lot of us frustration when we're learning new things because when we are learning something new we are essentially demanding a desired outcome and are repeatedly frustrated when our brain cells can't produce the desired outcome as fast as we want. There's one thing to be said for not watering a plant and so it can never grow a leaf, but if you give it the perfect environment, the cells of the plant can only produce a leaf at a certain rate and in its own certain way. Just like that, if you've saturated your brain with information, you have to wait some period of chronological time for your brain to actually put it together so you can think something new. \nRamana Maharshi's method was based on this which was just holding \"I\" in thought, and putting our attention on what that thought actually points to and represents in reality. Just hold the thought \"I\" and let your brain cells figure it out automatically over time, because they will, as it does represent something you know to exist already. I think it's a great method because it sounds so stupid to most of us based on our conventional understanding of \"I am the thinker\" because how can you possible learn anything from thinking only one thought? But it works because it recognizes how learning actually works, which is a lot like Olimar in Pikmin blowing his whistle and all the little Pikmin go and solve the problem for him, he doesn't do anything, but it does take varying degrees of time depending on the task.","timestamp":"2023-08-23T10:26:13.240000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-23T10:27:33.349000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1143780925419827312","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1141635420833198081","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's fundamentally undoing a deeply held belief, so it is similar to being raised in a very religious household and eventually losing your belief in a particular faith or god.

It is possible to incrementally improve your emotional state, whether through changing your beliefs like in talk-therapy, or through conforming to your beliefs (coaching), but this is ultimately removing all of them not changing them or fulfilling them. Usually people experience some degree of \"incremental improvement\" because along the process they figure out things they've never questioned before and resolve them, but its ultimately like \"repeated Tetris moments\" until you realize there is no max level, the game keeps going on, and this phenomenon is essentially turning that game off. It is common to feel \"I'm getting closer\" because your emotional state and knowledge improves, but that happens normally in our life through achievement, better resources, social skills, relationships, security etc. Nothing wrong with that, that's great, but what I'm describing isn't something you get closer to itself, it's either there or it isn't, but it usually requires diligence and effort for most people, again it is like undoing a belief, not a new discovery.","timestamp":"2023-08-17T07:31:34.887000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-17T07:34:41.990000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"710001930654449664","username":"smorto","avatar":"a_2578ee9c37b5e2545c410645128d322c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"soi","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b4dcf63b6af2e20cba91af61c0e3a8a7","sku_id":"1333866045261480007","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1349849614286585866","asset":"nameplates/nameplates/cityscape/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_CITYSCAPE_A11Y","palette":"violet"}},"display_name_styles":{"font_id":8,"effect_id":3,"colors":[16725190]},"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1141604324959584276","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1141633779249729598","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The record plays what it's currently playing, it can't touch the future, the past, or \"Me\" because you're the needle touching the record.

The \"object\" called consciousness is just a thought, I agree, but again, thought is part of consciousness. Consciousness exists, and part of consciousness is thought, but language and all the communication we are doing on Discord is a function of thought, which is occurring in our consciousness as we do it. I don't think we're disagreeing, but it is really important to observe in your own experience that the linear and simple relationship is there, because instead of exchanging words you can actually check from your own POV and see the real thing. We aren't trying to ascend to a higher plane of conscious experience, we are just checking what is there and understanding it. We can't exist both as the subject and the object of the thought - the thinker and the thought - but we do exist. The realization is to observe that there is no thinker, there is only the thought. Self-realization is to some degree the realization that thinking is not layered, it isn't segmented or related to another thought, it is just one thought after another with absolutely no characteristic or hierarchy, like a tv screen displaying its current signal. The effort to create a hierarchy of experience for example can be valuable in a physics based model of consciousness if we were building an AI robot or something, but it is not useful for understanding consciousness and thought, because thought does not have relationship to another thought. It is just one thought, then another thought. Thought is experienced like a DJ putting the needle on the record and taking it off when we pay attention to another sense. Our entire self-image or concept of \"Me\" is always exactly one thought deep, because \"real me\" can only think one thought at a time.","timestamp":"2023-08-17T07:24:34.255000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-17T10:12:49.406000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1141076344839614535","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1141629894200135701","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I'll emphasize that the entire enquiry is \"What am I?\".

The irony is that it is coming from a place of humility we say that, and recognizing our own intelligence and desires we are saying \"maybe I can't climb this mountain\". When it comes to achievement, that might just be being honest with ourselves, there is nothing wrong with saying \"yep, not gonna be in the NBA\" etc. In contrast, self-realization is really complete humility.

It might be more relatable if I described the whole concept as \"You don't have emotional response to your thoughts\", just to instill a more tangible understanding. This isn't exactly correct, but it is correct for 98% of our experiences and might be more understandable because the concept of \"self\" is of course open to a lot of interpretation depending on the person.\n\nMaybe think about this example: our lives are usually filled with stress, anxiety, physical problems, worry, ambition, regret, etc. etc. In contrast, when we play an RPG like Zelda or Mario, what do we experience? We do not create emotional identification with those characters because we are obviously not them. We view ourselves as the player inputting data through the controller to the game; nevertheless, we are also playing the game through the rules imposed by the video game environment, and are exposed to the character's world that is analogous to our own problems, worries, ambitions, quests, and objectives. Do we enjoy doing those quests? Usually yes. If you didn't, you would just stop playing the game or do a different quest that you do want to do. We like playing video games because they are essentially fantastical analogies to our own lives that allow us to experience accelerated personal growth and no emotional relationship to our self-concept. The main change in experience is that it is possible to have a very similar emotional relationship to our actual selves, other than to physical pain or danger. All of us as human beings are just like Mario, Zelda, or like plants and all other animals, we have certain characteristics and naturally have the desire to act them out. Humans are characterized by our long lifespans, dexterous hands, and capacity for thought, which allows to use knowledge to creatively model and anticipate our interactions with physical reality and act upon that. Humans act that out, each of us different than the other but similar in nature.","timestamp":"2023-08-13T09:46:49.422000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"185473441866973185","username":"vistascan","avatar":"a846f9a62d880bf9e69f286ffdcfc376","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"vistascan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1139927301925122078","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1140213396344668274","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yes, and sensory experience is the entirety of what \"Me\" is.","timestamp":"2023-08-13T09:20:57.829000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1139925468175413308","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1139870629559029850","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Lean into this some more.

My only rejection to it is similar to the Sam Harris debacle we all got into earlier, which is that I would firmly state that there is no \"self\", there is no object or entity called \"consciousness\" independent of experience. The effort to identify subjective experience is our self-image, which is the constant effort to try to imagine our experience as a theoretical object of thought no matter how abstract or reductive. It's not that it can't be logically pointed to, or that it is \"illusory\" or that it is \"untouchable by knowledge\", it doesn't exist. The effort to try to dismiss or confirm something that isn't there is the problem itself. The whole pursuit is not seeing that you can't think about yourself because thought can't do it, it is to realize that you can't think about yourself because you *are* thought. You are seeing, you are hearing, you are all sensory perception, you are not an object that acts, you are the action. Only when you piece them all together do we become aware there is a an object (human) that creates these experiences and we say \"that's me\", and then call it \"my body\" or at a deeper level \"consciousness\".","timestamp":"2023-08-12T10:13:22.056000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1139854166081163275","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1139860850719588412","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah I thought it would be funny lol","timestamp":"2023-08-12T10:00:04.402000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1139854166081163275","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1139859854429782047","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think the difficult thing of this entire phenomenon is that it's not a concept to intellectualize and scrutinize logically. I am trying to communicate the change in ongoing personal experience with knowledge or a diagram, which isn't what it is. The only important thing is answering the question \"What, exactly, am I?\". The resulting change in perception is what I'm describing, I'm not trying to be like \"look at it this way instead of this way!\" That's just more self-knowledge and part of our self-image. \n\nWith regards to my drawing, and again, this isn't supposed to be \"think of it this way instead of that way\", but personally I am hoping to communicate that it is possible to not have any emotional or knowledge-based identification with \"yourself\" at all. Obviously you move your hands and see out of your own eye's etc. But the idea of \"What if I die?\" is never a concern because you aren't the human being explicitly, you are the sensory experience being generated by the human being's relationship with other material phenomenon. I again want to emphasize this is a realization, it isn't a \"point of view\" it is absolutely what you currently experience it isn't an alternative theory or idea. It isn't knowledge. You experience signals like pain, fear, etc. to try to avoid death and physical suffering, but if the human dies it doesn't matter because it is seen as no different than something that happened yesterday or waking up from a dream: it's just the cessation of previous experience, there is no problem.\n\nThe key insight to examine is that \"The Signal\" is always occurring right now. There is no such thing as \"yesterday's signal\" or \"tomorrow's signal\" those concepts are itself the signal you are and are currently experiencing.

I only figured it out because I spent most of my life trying to solve my problems through material self-improvement and then eventually getting to a point where I realized that no one actually knew how to live and be happy and that nothing I could physically accomplish would ever make me truly happy. Every person I ever studied or researched, it didn't matter their degree, their status, their intelligence, they all suffered the same. Everyone is just speaking from their own experience and rationalizing it and that eventually had no value. I sort of thought that if my life would be a permanent up and down struggle there was really no point unless I completely misunderstood everything. I don't think almost anyone has questioned their own wellbeing because nearly everyone is in a constant state of \"If I just had/did this, then things would be better\" there is no effort to understand what the whole entirety of living is because we are always looking one step ahead at \"better\". This is pretty much all I think about now, but my whole life the concept of \"thinking about life\" seemed like a waste of time, but really the only question worth figuring out is \"you exist, what the fuck? What are you?\". Unfortunately in the past, almost everyone who has the same realization came either from a place of enormous privilege and had no further thing to materially achieve, or from a place of realizing no achievement or object would ever make them happy, and that is currently still a rare circumstance for most people to experience personally. It doesn't have to be that way at all, but I think that is the main reason no one really gets J.K. like you mentioned. From an academic perspective it is never studied or shared because it isn't incremental or measured change. It is 1 to 0 like a light-switch, and that isn't the construct of knowledge that academia can easily pursue.","timestamp":"2023-08-12T09:39:27.417000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-12T09:41:53.264000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1025564560054304901","username":"tobl25","avatar":"2116603f26c165f25eaf324f5a7f5808","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Tobs","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1139843594337918976","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1139850618413006869","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Don't take this literally as \"yo bro are you saying you aren't the human being???\".

I originally tried to understand the speakers on this topic not out of looking to make myself \"better\" but out of desperation that I would basically be miserable for the rest of my life if there wasn't something else. The thing that really grabbed me was that a few speakers seemed to really passionately be trying to communicate something, and I just couldn't understand. I'd never found anything that couldn't be incrementally understood and learned over time, it was like a complete wall. I was so frustrated and all I wanted was to understand what on earth these people were trying to communicate and that led me to understand basically by accident. I wasn't looking for anything other to know what on earth they were trying to say and I wanted to know with absolute certainty. If you are looking to \"get\" something, you will never get it from this type of stuff, and if there is a desire for self-improvement my own view is that it's much better to pursue that in material self-improvement than this.

Nearly all people believe they understand themselves better as they get older, and so their self-knowledge subjectively has increased, and because their self-knowledge is their self-image that they conform to and react to it is itself a greater proportion of \"who I am\". The accumulation of self-knowledge, as long as we are attached to our imaginary self, is in part a huge part of who we are, and is the reason many people become resistant to change, stubborn, and \"stuck in their ways\" as they get older. Their knowledge of themselves is in large part who they are as it creates emotional response in them, and the older you are the more your beliefs about yourself become ingrained to the point they are nearly entirely what you believe you are. The point of the chart is to illustrate  \"what I am\" never changes at all and is always perfect knowledge (no use of thought to know the self).

I'm not really interested in doing a podcast at the moment but thank you for the offer. I spent the last 1.5 years basically feeling compelled to spend all my time writing about this, editing it down and making my hour long video, and I feel that now I've finally done that major part I can get back to seriously working on the things I want to do to progress my life in other areas. \n\nJust to your question, I don't personally think it is possible to understand those statements unless there is the genuine insight, otherwise it is just an idea agreeing with an idea and creating another belief. I think it is a lot of people's personally philosophy to some degree because it doesn't map out in the their conscious experience or behaviour. I mentioned this in my video but it is a bit like saying \"I don't give a fuck\" when the person does, in fact, give a fuck. It is not upholding a philosophy for external validation, which is ego, it is having none at all. If you are anxious of a future event or regret something embarrassing you did, or are angry at some idiots political opinion, then that necessitates the belief you can think about yourself. I think where we might be coming at this from different angles is that I think it is often recognizable that we can't think about ourselves *directly* in that we aren't literally in our thoughts, in the same way we can have dreams, get frightened, wake up, and then be like \"oh, wasn't real\". What I'm saying is that there isn't even an illusory or imagined self. Like it completely stops existing. There is no comparison or contemplation of \"what is real\" or \"what is me\" there is only the \"real me\". A dream is just as real as a thought, which is just as real as seeing something which is just as real as touching something, there is only one continuous stream of undifferentiated experience.

So no anxiety, anger at other's opinions, envy, jealousy, comparison, regret, longing, lust for a particular person, emotional hurt, self-pride, superiority, inferiority, or any emotion that arises in relationship to thought and beliefs about ourself. I experience our common base emotions (fear/anger) only in relationship to physical danger or if someone communicates to you that you have hurt them, then I feel shame. All dissipate once the stimulus is gone. Self-realization has always been the end of suffering, not the end of physical pain, pain is very useful or else you will hurt yourself. Emotions are also there in relationship to immediate physical danger so you don't hurt yourself (fear), can hurt other living beings only to protect innocent life (anger), and so you don't hurt others (shame). All other emotions are caused by a recursion of \"Me\" that lives in imagination and creates unnecessary emotional response.\n\nTo your last line, the problem is that because we believe we can think about ourselves, we create an imaginary entity called \"Me\" that we emotionally react to in thought. Self-realization is the actual cessation of the functioning of this false entity that creates irrational emotional response. People often say \"Self-realization is realizing there is no self to realize\", but almost everyone misinterprets that as \"Here is a cave, nothing in it\", but it actually means \"you are in a cave, come out of the cave\". It is meaningless for me to say \"all anxiety is irrational and doesn't need to be experienced\" because people still suffer from anxiety, it doesn't cause it to stop. Actually dissolving the imagination of \"Me\" that causes anxiety is important and why I try to communicate this to others. It changed my life completely and I'm sure many people are searching desperately for the same thing, but are completely lost and don't know this exists.","timestamp":"2023-08-09T07:59:47.815000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"648856100367630336","username":"trenblack","avatar":"da561b440490ebd3de214476ce925e91","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Trenblack","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1138739831493627955","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1138739167308808293","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"That isn't my understanding of them, that is my understanding I'm trying to tell you","timestamp":"2023-08-09T07:42:54.237000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"648856100367630336","username":"trenblack","avatar":"da561b440490ebd3de214476ce925e91","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Trenblack","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1138738943278448701","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1138737739504824380","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@trenblack I think it's better if you guys don't worry about guessing the veracity of anything that I or other people imply or state about their own state.

Not that they are illusory, they do not exist at all. I'm not saying this is a concentrated state, or a cultivated awareness, it is our permanent and default state that never deviates or changes. It is what we already are if we are able to physiologically end our self-image or \"illusory self\", which we have created by the conscious belief we can think about ourselves, which we can't. Anxiety does not need to be avoided, it does not arise, anger at other's opinions does not need to be avoided, it does not arise. Regret of the past does not need to be avoided, it does not arise. There is no need to meditate if there is the \"a-ha!\" moment because you realize instantly \"oh, I'm always meditating\". You as well are meditating right now, and always have been your whole life. The belief there is \"two states\" or that you can \"focus on consciousness and its content\" is itself dualism. If you aren't focusing on your awareness then what are you focusing on? Something you aren't aware of? There is no different between walking down the street chatting with your friend and consciously focusing on your awareness of self. Every second any of us have existed all we are doing is acting out and perceiving our actual self we just haven't realized it. You can't be distracted from a non-dual awareness because the realization itself is seeing that there isn't two things, there is only one thing. Your attention can't ever be drawn from meditation to non-meditation because there is no difference between the two things in the first place.","timestamp":"2023-08-09T07:35:31.390000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-09T07:37:48.381000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1138737302961659966","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think I'm mostly just saying what I said before but I don't think I'm misunderstanding Harris, and I do think you are still misunderstanding me.

All emotional relationship to those holograms is irrational, as they are not us, and that is what is being pointed to. \n\nThe thing I, and others talking on the subject, are vehemently pointing out is the idea that \"You're creating your valence, your feelings\" is nonsensical. There is no actor. There is no \"me\" and \"my feelings\" there is only \"feelings\" there is only \"thought\" there is only \"touch\" there is only \"what I'm experiencing\", there is no actor, there is no \"experiencer\", that is the cause of mental suffering and irrational emotional strife. The most important thing is to break away from intellectualism and to see things through your own eyes and brain, including the thoughts that are attached to our knowledge creating those intellectual ideas that causes irrational and unnecessary experience to end. It is the kind of thing a 3 year old can do more effectively than an 80 year old philosopher, and one of the things that I think makes it really hard for a lot of modern, smart people to get, because we don't want to examine our own thinking, we want to take a hop, skip and jump through adopting other's knowledge to achieve a hypothetical goal or higher understand.","timestamp":"2023-08-08T10:57:39.476000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-08T11:07:11.654000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1138425787347906662","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Haven't watched it as the message got deleted or can't load for me right now.

I have no problem with someone hosting a seminar or a event where people pay to attend, that's great, and can help provide income to a person with good communication to provide more expansive and beneficial services. The only thing I'm pushing back towards that you initially linked was a guy who may have some good quotes if they are his, and again nothing against some good quotes, but their website is very predatory in my view. I'll leave it up to you to decide of course, but if you read some of the Q&A on the guys site it is written by himself to himself. No human being says \"please, master\" or \"Then why does the Truth come to you and not to me?\" other than someone in their own word document fantasy. I won't speak on their behalf, but the only thing I'm concerned with is individuals gaining the confidence and wanting to inquire into who they are as individual people, and that is always accessible to everyone the moment the choose to look there. It is, again, just understanding what you already are, you don't need anyone to tell you. Just ask yourself the question.","timestamp":"2023-08-08T10:33:28.165000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1138412242010906634","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's your own thoughts and decisions, so do your own thing.

That is the source of common mental illness in the form of anxiety, anger at other's opinions, envy, jealousy, regret, longing, desire, lust, pride, comparison, and our host of psychological maladies. We believe we can think about ourselves and through emotional relationship to our self-knowledge we create emotional suffering through comparison of our past to our present to our future, and to our knowledge of ourselves and impressions of others.

Everything in thought that you think relates to you is your self-image. I think it is fairly straightforward to look at a date you're about to go on, get anxious at the thought of \"what if I fuck it up\" and think \"that is just my imagination\", but it is not as easy to say \"My Mom is very ill and might die in two weeks, I am very scared of that\" and then be like \"ugh, that's just my imagination, don't need to worry!\" When they are literally suffering right now. Sorry for being dark, but it has to be taken extremely seriously for there to be resolution. The key to the whole understanding is not figuring out what you are not, but figuring out what you are. The key to that is seeing and understanding exactly why it is not possible to think about yourself, and how present action and behaviour is all that is necessary to solve absolutely all problems or experiences you ever have.

I have literally no clue what I'm going to type or say. No one else does either for themselves. It is basically the same way ChatGPT works, we just get pinged on an idea and start talking, and the entire thing is automatic. Words or chunks of sentences just follow each other in sequence. The difference is when we play football or piano we might kinda notice \"oh damn my fingers are just playing everything by themselves!\" to some degree, but when we think we constantly say \"no, I am thinking, this is me\". I think the delineation is still a mistake, because for example when we are just learning the piano, we are like \"ok C note, that is this one, ok got it\" and we press the key, and we say \"this is obviously me consciously doing this\" but then once we have muscle memory and a whole routine down, we might think \"Jesus, it's like it is playing itself, this must be my subconscious!\" But that is in some way similar to how we walk. It is very difficult when we are learning as a child and are consciously trying to do it, but now we just do it all automatically. I like the computer analogy, because it is basically writing a script that works, storing it in memory, and not dealing with it again unless it stops working effectively. Instead of running the script which is \"press the C note\" we run the script which is \"play Claire de Lune\", and because that involves a prolonged period of not thinking, and just physically executing the script, we are like \"holy shit what is this state that doesn't involve thinking\", which is only created because we can't stop thinking normally.","timestamp":"2023-08-05T06:37:09.680000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-05T06:41:35.020000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1137096552582750240","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1137270895069642782","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Hahah, to go back to my streaming days I'd just say poggers dude. hahahahhaha.

From there, there can then be inquiry and realization into our true nature as biological organisms that doesn't require conscious effort and conformity to our self-knowledge. Not to be too dire, but when I first started metabolizing the concept I thought it meant some form of psychological suicide, but it really isn't that. It is just recognizing that self-knowledge is created to try to understand ourself. The realization it cannot do that, and why, causes it to permanently end. This completely ends the concept of \"Me\", and all action is then automatic and natural, and you act out your life like a seed that was once planted in the ground.

I think this is basically the struggle you've mentioned before, and is viewing consciousness as an object. The entirety of what someone like J. Krishnamurti talks about and I agree with is realizing consciousness is not an object, it isn't a screen or a stage as is commonly perceived in western philosophy or psychology, or perhaps originated by what you've described. Perception is itself consciousness. There isn't \"five main senses\" that occur to \"consciousness\" there is just the senses themselves, and this is something that can be realized, but the conscious actor of \"me\" is largely perceived to be some form of ownership over the actions that occur in consciousness. We say \"something has occurred to \"Me\" (consciousness) and now \"I\" (consciousness) will respond\". When in reality what actually happens is that one sensory perception occurs, and then there is immediate awareness of another sensory perception that then acts in response. We can all witness this every single moment of our lives. In our day to day life this is usually thought that leads to thought, which is part of the confusion, but it can be any sensory perception.

In your Persona 5 example that is what I'd suggest every human being is doing already. It is our beliefs about ourselves that create error, not understanding. How is it possible to say \"I am doing something I wasn't meant to do?\" Other than creating an imaginary alternate world and believing \"that self\" is a preferred reality? It is a misunderstanding of thinking. Their suffering is unnecessary and the angst is caused by not realizing their behaviour is automatic. We struggle immensely to \"figure out\" what to do in our lives and how to act, but who is figuring it out? It's just your own nature figuring out its own nature, there isn't a \"Me\" that is doing anything. Where do your thoughts come from? Is a good thing to look at, but again I want to emphasize that self-enquiry is looking in your own first-person subjective view, it isn't cracking open the philosophy textbooks to hear another opinion and agree or disagree with it. That again is your own nature holding something in thought and agreeing or disagreeing based on your accumulated beliefs. If there is an understanding of why it is not possible to think about yourself and what you are, self-knowledge stops operating. It isn't new knowledge or another idea, there is no conscious effort at all. If you are trying to solve 2+2, then thinking stops when it gets to 4. Thinking about yourself permanently ends when it finds the answer, or rather figures out why it can't find the answer.","timestamp":"2023-08-04T07:33:33.883000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-08-04T07:37:25.032000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1136924872346451969","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I see what you're getting at, but the entire point of what I'm saying is that it is not possible to think about yourself.

We spend our whole lives trying to refine our self-image, which is our knowledge of ourselves and our life. This causes emotional relationship to our imagination because we believe we are connected to it in some way, which we aren't. The usual knowledge based insights that we have just leads to more precise knowledge that we use for further insights, and is knowledge accumulating itself and then being refined repeatedly.

It strikes me that what you're describing with your idea of realizations is like how knowledge works in a similar way to Tetris. You accumulate knowledge, then finally when a certain number of blocks are in a line they collapse into an insight. And then more blocks. This is what I would call learning, and is the accumulation and refinement of knowledge and I still do that like anyone and often do it poorly. I think that's a great thing, and useful in many external applications of thought, but what I'm trying to suggest is that when it comes to understanding ourselves, this entire concept has to be thrown away. The insight I'm pointing to is the throwing away of the constant conscious activity of trying to figure out who we are. We spend our whole lives trying to figure ourselves out, but that is an error because we already know ourselves perfectly: we are it all the time. \n\nI'd emphasize, just if you're open to it, but what I am trying to describe is looking into subjective experience that is your own life and understanding entirely what that is. It isn't a philosophical or knowledge based argument. You have to completely realize the futility of self-knowledge to understanding what I'm trying to communicate, because that is all I'm trying to communicate. A genuine subtraction. If academia, phillsophy, knowledge and experience is a pyramid of greater memory, this is a whirlpool or blackhole that I will personally say I have never experienced anything like it before. The phenomenon I'm describing is based on an insight that eliminates the concept of \"Me\", permanently changes emotional relationship to thought, and then there is subsequent personal experience and action.

If we wanted to have a debate purely on the value of statistically validated mental health treatments I would probably make the argument than nearly everyone gets therapy but really needs coaching. There is nothing more statistically significant for people's mental health than reducing their intake of caffeine and alcohol, getting enough sleep, being physically fit, eating well, increasing your income to what you need, and having meaningful friends and relationships. Almost all these things are what coaches are for, which is to help you achieve or get something that you want, while therapy has overlaps but is generally much more oriented around coping with unfortunate problems and circumstances, rather than being coached by someone who is an expert at radically altering them. If someone wanted to do meditation over therapy I wouldn't discourage them. If someone wanted to do therapy over self-enquiry I wouldn't discourage them.

It also is known as talk therapy, counseling, psychosocial therapy or, simply, therapy.

Many intelligent people who have thought it through have been areligious (or without self) since the dawn of civilization, but thousands of years later most of the world is still religious, and those that don't follow religion follow political ideologies or other belief systems.

This is what I referred to as “pruning the leaves on the tree” which is taking each belief one by one and trying to improve or fix it. I am trying to point to something several layers deeper, which is that what holds all beliefs together is our self-knowledge, what we think “me” is, and below that is all memory, the entirety of what thought can access. Seeing in conscious experience that there is no necessity for self-knowledge at all, only a self that is capable of thought, causes self-knowledge to end and all beliefs about ourself are simultaneously concluded. This is not changing our beliefs to “be more helpful” which may reduce our anxiety, depression, anger, or comparison, it is removing them entirely. I’m an advocate for CBT because it helps people practically improve their lives and beliefs about themselves, and as I’ve said before, the enormous corpus of scientific knowledge will help modify our behaviours with statistically helpful strategies. I think this is the most important thing for most people to do, because if I met a struggling 50 year old who had a deep fear they’ve sinned and will be going to hell, it is likely they really haven’t done much introspection and are going to be more benefitted by incremental improvements to their emotional state.","timestamp":"2023-07-30T06:14:41.930000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1135093010263183390","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I’m suggesting that approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy are part way on the walk to exactly what I’m describing, and a subset of this phenomenon. CBT works by changing our inaccurate and unhelpful beliefs and encourages us to change our habits and behaviour to create a more positive environment for ourselves. CBT has origins in stoic philosophy, leans on inspirations from epistemology, and is largely an evidence-based successor to Freud’s popularization of talk therapy. This is the academic origin and is in the literature and Wiki already, it isn’t my explicit opinion, it is already established as what it is. The shift in academia and practice in the last 80 years has just gone from a practitioner analyzing the person and supposing an underlying subconscious root, which was supposed to be the origin of our beliefs, to now being focused on techniques and lines of questioning that help an individual more accurately understand their current beliefs and behaviour and create positive change. From CAMH: “In CBT, clients learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes and beliefs related to the emotional and behavioural reactions that cause them difficulty” and from Wikipedia: “Mainstream cognitive behavioral therapy assumes that changing maladaptive thinking leads to change in behavior and affect,[47] but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself”. What is slowly being cranked out by the machine of academia is that thinking itself is not the problem, our emotional relationship to thoughts is. It is understood that beliefs play a role in this, but no one understands why because they themselves still have emotional relationship to beliefs. The underlying root is that emotional relationship to thoughts occurs because we believe we can think about ourselves, but we actually cannot.

I don’t think I’ve ever done so intentionally other than saying it is a conventional way to improve our life or that it only addresses our ailments partially. I don’t see the problem with this as most therapists will say the same thing and it was just meant as a statement of what I think it is and I don’t think that deviates from common thought. No therapist is coming to a session thinking they’re going to fix someone if they know what they are doing; they are coming with knowledge, training, and experience to help a patient improve their own life and self-understanding and is one of the reasons finding a professional who resonates with you is so important. If the further criticism is that my confidence in my own views implies that any other view is wrong, I understand, and I think I can do that better in the Discord channel often, but I don’t mean to suggest that by asserting one thing is true it means another thing is wrong. I don’t think that therapy, coaching, philosophy, religion, or spirituality is “wrong”, I think they all skate the surface of a much deeper and fundamental understanding and that is what I’m trying to communicate. I’m not saying “*but*, I’m saying *and then*”. I am additionally certain it is an objective phenomenon, because it is my own experience and is not just an “idea”. It is a real phenomenon and would show up on a brain scan as a lack of emotional activity in response to thought, communication, and dreams, and if it is possible to reliably check this, I would be happy to oblige.","timestamp":"2023-07-30T06:13:51.155000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-30T07:13:48.778000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1135092822253510706","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@revinat0r @that.blackcat Just caught up with your conversation.

High level brain cells. If I'm not mistaken (perhaps apocryphal or me just being wrong) Pythagoras spent a lot of his time trying to bring Eastern mysticism and thought into the west. He reminds me a lot of Maslow in his very deep later years. If you have more info on any cool figures and videos I'd love to hear it. My historical knowledge is pretty bad but I like learning about past influential figures I appreciate. I remember looking at \"what was the population of Athens when Socrates was there?\" and the answer was \"100,000 to 200, 000\", And I thought \"what the fuck, where are all the Socrates now?

By saying \"I am the soul\" and the other says \"no, I am also the soul so it can't be you\" we then say \"oh no, but I mean like *my* soul.

The point of the exercise is to see that any expression, which requires thought, is not yourself. The actual thing cannot be communicated. In the same way we constantly think about our selves, our past, and our futures, but it is not us we are thinking about. I can describe my holiday, it is not the holiday. I can describe my partner, the description is not my partner. Seeing what the \"self\" actually is, is what is important and causes everything to drop away. If I said \"there is no self\" and a buddhist monk said \"there is no self\" we have to automatically assume they are both saying the same thing, but they are perhaps pointing to very different things. Our difficulty in self-enquiry is we are not used to subjective examination.

It immediately triggers everyone's \"oh god some more spiritual nonsense, this is just religion or a cult\". Because it is not academic, almost no one perceives its value. Alan Watts for example is very appealing, like a Bill Nye the Mystic Guy, because he makes it philosophical, but he does not understand. Jordan Peterson helps a lot of people who are struggling to improve their lives, but he does not understand. Every TED talk you've ever listened to might be insightful, but they do not understand. It is not that they can't be helpful or life changing to others, and a cardinal might be wise, but they do not understand.

It is not ontology, spirituality, religion, or any form of thinking. It is, plain and simply: you exist. You have been having an ongoing experience of \"me\" since the first moment you can consciously remember; it continues to this day, and will continue until the organism that you currently are dies or ceases to create sensory experience. What is that? What is going on? It is not pointing to what the \"physical world\" is, which is material science, or \"how my thoughts work\" which is philosophy and psychology, but seeing, clearly, what the entirety of what \"experience\" or \"me\" is. It is genuinely not perceived to be a field that exists other than talk therapy, which, as I said in my videos, is just pruning the leaves of the tree of self-understanding largely through accident. To directly address your \"reinventing the wheel\" concept, it is not a known phenomenon because it is not something you know. It is what humans would all experience if they didn't create the concept of \"me\" when they were about 1-3 years old. From my own view, and what has made me passionate about communicating this, is that most others don't share the same thought-based approach that is natural for a lot of people today, and I recognize that what I pursued before is what a lot of people are currently doing now in error. I hope that I can communicate largely to my past self, because that is also still very much the culture of today.","timestamp":"2023-07-27T07:10:42.421000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-27T07:17:55.896000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"648856100367630336","username":"trenblack","avatar":"da561b440490ebd3de214476ce925e91","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Trenblack","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1134013201684627497","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1134010944222142564","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"No worries and appreciate you being here.

This is completely incorrect and I only push back a bit because I think this view can be quite misleading, and is again the modern belief of what meditation is. If our self-image is dissolved there is no necessity to ever train yourself to meditate or make any effort to try to experience something other than what you are experiencing because there is no longer an undesired thought and emotion that you are trying to get away from. It is the misunderstanding that there are objects in our imagination (me, the past, and future) that creates this illusion that we can avoid those things. The whole point of meditation originally was to realize that there are no objects in thought, thought is the object, meaning that it is not possible to worry about the past or the future, not that it is an illusion. If you actually could think about the past or the future, perhaps it could be worried over, but it is not the case. While I'm sure Sam has a lot of points that might reflect what I'm saying, we are categorically talking about two completely different things. He speaks very well and says a lot of things I agree with, and is similar to Alan Watts in my view. Both are excellent teachers on the broad topic, but the knowledge of the topic is unfortunately not necessarily the thing, my only hesitation with Sam is that his prescription of meditation and its function leads people much farther away from what I'm describing as it is something that actually strengthens our self-image, but does not dissolve it.","timestamp":"2023-07-27T02:34:58.362000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-27T02:38:42.748000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133950610216067173","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah no worries. I'm very glad he is sharing those concepts with a mainstream audience, it certainly is great so many more people are thinking about it. I'll just say that in my view he has very effectively diagnosed the problem, but the way he talks about meditation and present experience is still a subset of the problem, not outside of it or its solution. It is not sufficient to realize the self is an illusion, it has to be completely dissolved for there to be significant and transformative change. Much of what he is saying is like observing yourself in the mirror and realizing \"this is an illusion, I am not my reflection, and I am not harmed if this mirror is shattered\", that might be a great insight if you were previously worried about your reflection being harmed, and is great jumping off point for the self-enquiry I've described, but what I am trying to communicate is that if the false self is understood entirely, it disappears, and in the analogy the mirror turns to glass. There is no reflection, it is gone completely, and \"meditation\" as it's used in the modern sense, is permanent. Modern meditation in a sense is the effort to briefly experience what you naturally are, before then quickly losing it again.","timestamp":"2023-07-27T02:34:53.259000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-27T02:37:53.023000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133933858413363310","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Is this representative of his current views? https://youtu.be/w36XtC8ahN0?t=173","timestamp":"2023-07-27T01:28:19.318000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"video","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w36XtC8ahN0&start=173","title":"Sam Harris: Meaning of Life","description":"Lex Fridman Podcast full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dC_nRYIDZU\nPlease support this podcast by checking out our sponsors:\n- National Instruments (NI): https://www.ni.com/perspectives\n- Belcampo: https://belcampo.com/lex and use code LEX to get 20% off first order\n- Athletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/lex and use code LEX to...","color":16711680,"author":{"name":"Lex Clips","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJIfeSCssxSC_Dhc5s7woww"},"provider":{"name":"YouTube","url":"https://www.youtube.com"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w36XtC8ahN0/maxresdefault.jpg","proxy_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/A2mNhuxlQ06dpVkwY1cQqTZ2ZT3gISF1wGhqEwBh4mo/https/i.ytimg.com/vi/w36XtC8ahN0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720,"flags":0},"video":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w36XtC8ahN0?start=173","width":1280,"height":720,"flags":0},"content_scan_version":3}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133932149691658361","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Could you maybe link me to a video where you think he does a good job explaining his current perspectives?

While this is speeding through it, the reason thought and emotion are linked is because they are both born out of belief, which operates constantly like a tripwire.

This thought and emotion causes action that will try to repair the belief and reset the tripwire, such as disagreeing with the person's insult or seeking validation from others that they were wrong. All beliefs also have a common thread which is they relate to \"me\" which is the entity we think we are. All of our beliefs are ultimately connected in some way to \"Me\", and are in fact what \"Me\" is constituted from. This \"Me\" is our self-image, our imagined self.

I am describing the realization that causes the permanent end of self-knowledge, as it is not useful and born of a misunderstanding of yourself. I haven't listened to his guided meditations, but it is likely what he is teaching is concentration on bodily sensations and sensory perceptions to become knowledgeable of how they are experienced through subjective experience.  Most forms of meditation nowadays are some variation of that and revolve around \"simply observe your thoughts like clouds in the sky, observe that when anxiety briefly arises, it is a sensation in the body and then flutters away\" and this can bring awareness to transient nature of our experiences. If you enjoy doing this, then by all means, but what I am suggesting is that the whole concept is confused, in that it assumes there must be anger, anxiety, envy, jealousy, and other emotional relationship and we just have to learn to accept that, but that is not the case.","timestamp":"2023-07-27T00:45:44.339000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-27T00:47:56.183000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"648856100367630336","username":"trenblack","avatar":"da561b440490ebd3de214476ce925e91","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Trenblack","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1133909444414160926","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133898459158695937","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"If this occurs then it is immediately seen that all dream analysis is futile, and anyone researched or creating theories about it is suffering from their own misunderstanding of self. There is no necessity for a model of personal reality vs \"the real\" or modeling some kind of invisible hand that we intuit but cannot experience, those are all beliefs that form our self-image, which creates a feeling of always running away from something but also towards something else. Our neuroses are caused by the subjective belief that something is occurring to us that is not actually occurring to us. Permanent resolution can be found by inquiring into \"what is \"me?\" that is having things occur to it\" not through dividing the world into \"real\" and \"perceived\" which are still both subsets of \"perceived' because they are now both thoughts. I'd ultimately say that self-realization is seeing that all there is is \"the real\", there is no personal reality. The fear of living life without meaning is itself the self-image and the source of our suffering. Suffering is caused by the search for meaning when there never has been any to find. You yourself are the meaning and is what is eluding analysis by thought.","timestamp":"2023-07-26T23:07:39.478000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133898456797282304","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think he is fairly accurate at describing what his own self-image is, and how many people experience it similarly, but the difficulty like with a lot of psychologists or philosophers is they assume that the average experience of most people and their own base experience is \"correct\" and their theories are then just rationalizations or descriptions of their present experience and beliefs. What I am suggesting is that our base experience, emotionally and in relationship to thought, can physiologically (mildly) be permanently altered. Rather it would be \"unaltered\" and returned to its natural state, as our beliefs about our self are the distortion, not the correction. Lacan's \"Ideal I\" is a good observation of how our self-image operates, but I am suggesting that it is created through learned conditioning and is ultimately a mistaken belief about ourselves, not a human feature. A very common one held by nearly all people, but it is what causes our feeling of insufficiency and lack in our lives. Observing this is the case is not important, what is important is actually, physiologically realizing why the self-image is useless which causes it to end. In a similar way, a lot of what Lacan is saying reminds me of the psychoanalysts work on dream analysis, and what philosophers are largely doing is \"thought analysis\" which is not far off. What is still being missed is that when the psychoanalysts looked around and said \"well, everyone has nightmares right?\" \"yeah\" \"okay, better figure out what they mean\". But it is actually the case that all nightmares are caused by an incorrect belief about who we are, and finding the error in that belief causes them to permanently end.","timestamp":"2023-07-26T23:07:38.915000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-26T23:09:00.728000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"334879516142862346","username":"gokanaru","avatar":"6b777dcb6ac0fe2ce9b615ec3b9170ad","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Gokanaru","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1133889299843133521","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1133888503177035837","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think it is helpful in pointing out how the self-image operates in others, and is simply \"what I think is true\".

Not like \"the acorn is already the oak tree\" like in determinism, but that is it's nature. An acorn doesn't \"become\" an oak tree, that's what it is. From seed to sprout, from sapling to tree, it has always been the same entity. When you see a seed, you treat it with great care so you don't destroy it, when it is a sapling you might build it a little fence to keep it safe, and when it is big enough you simply leave it to its own devices. We always interact with plants and other animals \"exactly as they currently are\" because they don't use complex language and so we don't bother forming images in our minds of who they are and what they think, we just react to them as they appear. That is truly intelligent communication. Krishnamurti is pointing to the fact that human beings are the same way, but we cannot understand and communicate with another as they are because we create an image of them from our past hurt and desires and react to that instead. Think of the classic husband who is asked to take out out the garbage and when he doesn't do it right away the wife loses her mind, and then the husband stone walls her, knowing she will get over it. To the wife, she isn't reacting to her husband not taking out the garbage, she is reacting to her belief that her husband has no respect for her, doesn't appreciate a thing, and that he cares so little he couldn't make the effort to lift a finger. The husband at the same thinks \"god, my ungrateful wife, I work all day, providing for the family, I come home, and the moment I walk in the door it's nag nag nag, what a b-. I'll take out the garbage, let me rest for an hour or two for god's sake\".

I sincerely hope that nothing I'm saying comes off as callous or dismissive in any way, I know how challenging it can be for everyone involved and all that I have is compassion for anyone who is struggling with a lost one or for the one who has passed. Speaking genuinely from my own perspective where hopefully I'm able to help others. I think it's important to inquire to where our grief stems from, and see that much of is born from the feeling of \"I have lost something\". In order to feel you have lost something there must a belief that you had something. Whether is it social stablity, a dependable partner or guide, someone who took away your loneliness or sorrow, someone who brought you joy or made you feel valued. Whatever it may be, grief is born from the desire for something or someone, it isn't the absence of something. Grief comes from regret and and a feeling of hopelessness. That you wished things could have been different and that your current state of self is in disrepair. The most important thing to be examined when a loved one passes, if there is a feeling of sadness, is it for their loss, or our own? If they pass peacefully and with no regrets, then there is no need for sadness for them or at all, their life was exactly what it was meant to be. As anyone can relate to, the idea that our family or loved ones would be left grieving at our own death is of course tragic. No human intends o hurt others with their natural passing, and so why do we experience hurt? Our self-image causes us to grieve for ourselves, for our own loss, and that suffering causes suffering to others who see us grieving and they want our suffering to end, causing them suffering, and so on and so forth it creates the misery of death and the tragedy of love that is not separate from attachment. The only true tragedy of death is they aren't there for you to love them anymore, and if there is grief for that, then that is nothing to be avoided.","timestamp":"2023-07-25T07:54:13.750000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-25T08:15:58.211000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"384047378128175119","username":"sadnut69","avatar":"c6e6cf4eaab84d909c511cf1f23d76ed","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"SadNut69","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1133209322722181193","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132934418034610257","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"From one of your pdf's Tyler, this is a good segment and completely correct:\n\nMan is not searching for happiness.

It may be, there is no reason it couldn't be, but to re-use something I've said before, it's like getting undressed, it isn't putting on new clothes. If you extend the metaphor, if you feel that you don't like your current outfit, it doesn't strike you as the obvious first move to get fully naked, you sort of think \"well, I don't like my clothes, but maybe I could try some other clothes?\" and so there is naturally a time component to understanding. Based on what others have communicated, I think it might be helpful to understand that what you are trying to understand is, generally speaking, quite challenging. It isn't like reading a new philosophy and saying \"*yaas*, so true\", it is genuinely untying a very deeply woven knot you've likely been constructing since you were a very young kiddo and first learned the concept of \"me\". The entire enquiry, ultimately is \"I exist, I have always existed to my own understanding. What is that?\" It is isn't \"where did I come from?\" or \"how does my body work?\" it is that you exist, what the fuck? Alright, well better figure out what \"me\" is. The understanding of what sensory experience is, particularly thinking, is what causes you to realize \"oh, I wasn't what I thought I was\". It is not the realization \"oh I was this other cool thing, it is my pre-existing assumptions were never correct\".","timestamp":"2023-07-24T07:15:54.017000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132496991893598255","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"As an example, if you are 60 years old, have never had a partner, are unhealthy and unhappy, it is common for this person to be in a state of despair, because they believe \"It's hopeless, my life is in complete disrepair, it would take a herculean effort to get my life back on track to the point I could really live out my desire for partnership and a fulfilling life\". This is our self-image, and the source of our suffering. If what you are is understood, the circumstance of course doesn't change at all, but you realize that the only thing that is truly occurring is the thought \"I am discontent with my current circumstances\" and there is immediate action towards rectifying it, as there is no \"all or nothing\" view combined with despair. The emotion of despair comes to an end, there is simply peace, and then the thought: \"I am not content with my physical circumstance, surroundings and lifestyle\" and from that point there can be immediate action. The often repeated advice of \"clean up your room\" is based on this, although the people who give this advice usually don't understand why it works. The reason it is effective is because a person in despair will believe that cleaning up their room makes no difference in the big picture, but if they do it they'll realize \"well, my life isn't fixed, but I do I feel better than before, that's weird\" and it can open them up to a new way of thinking. If there is a true understanding of what you are and always have been, then the cause of this is seen very clearly - there never was a \"bigger narrative\", all that you ever experienced is what is occurring to you now, and by organizing your room the way you would like it to be, you are now having a more fulfilling experience. Happiness is experienced as \"expressing myself as I am\" it is not a state that is ever arrived at, it is the ongoing process of creation and self-expression, it has no \"objectives\" that need to be met.","timestamp":"2023-07-23T02:18:43.644000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-23T02:23:26.484000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132496988684955711","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I am very sorry to hear of your suffering, and thank you for sharing those resources. I have not heard of that person you referenced and have taken a brief look over their notable quotes and they seem to very much mirror my personal view. I thought a particularly good quote is \"anger is born of unfulfilled desire. It is born of unfulfilled expectation\". I'll expand on this because - while this is very true - it is also true for all other painful emotions that do not occur in relationship to immediate danger. A classic narcissist is frequently angry at others because they have developed a belief their self-image is objectively superior to others. When others treat them as they perceive them in everyday behaviour, which is not in such a lofty way as they believe themselves to be, they perceive that they are being diminished. If you have written an essay and believe it be an easy A or A+, and then receive a B- and a host of criticism, there is perceived injustice that this person must be out to get you. Like the quote suggests, a person like this will feel constantly angered and attacked by others because they think they aren't being treated how they expect to be treated. In a similar way, anxiety is ultimately the belief that something may hurt you and we pursue our imagination of a \"good outcome\" which is our desire for safety. Loneliness is not the feeling of being socially isolated, it is the desire for meaningful companionship. Despair and hopeless is not the feeling of loss or misfortune, it is the desire for something or a circumstance that you believe is out of your grasp and unobtainable.","timestamp":"2023-07-23T02:18:42.879000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-23T02:20:04.457000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"669978531165634611","username":"tylertt1","avatar":"66b0c692fe9afeeb7a71e4135beeb188","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Tyler","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1132441342413377646","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132487321011355779","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Thought this might be helpful to others: https://www.reddit.com/r/StayingInPodcast/comments/156ujej/not_using_thought/","timestamp":"2023-07-23T01:40:17.926000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"link","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/StayingInPodcast/comments/156ujej/not_using_thought/","title":"r/StayingInPodcast - Not using thought","description":"3 votes and 3 comments so far on Reddit","color":16777215,"provider":{"name":"reddit"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/kw3v0IsgPY2z31RbmM0qcuHL4mTUV4z1xE1VPRTSOec.jpg?auto=webp&s=c8c062d1f837c0bc34eab0907a3280196762bf1c","proxy_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/5EmrXTl2JcC2Q1l7QdDAoMO8l2c9sZVdD1HG_Qigc48/%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc8c062d1f837c0bc34eab0907a3280196762bf1c/https/external-preview.redd.it/kw3v0IsgPY2z31RbmM0qcuHL4mTUV4z1xE1VPRTSOec.jpg","width":480,"height":360,"content_type":"image/jpeg","flags":0},"content_scan_version":2}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132457167895658516","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"This is great!","timestamp":"2023-07-22T23:40:28.863000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"389613832223588357","username":"revinat0r","avatar":"3b91db51d86cc3931154ffe4b340802c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"revin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1132454013120561173","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1132275564858851400","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You can't say there is no \"self\" because \"xyz\" you have to see what the self is, and then question \"what is it?\".

I'll just add in that while I reinforce his sentiment in the podcast, and appreciate him communicating this with the conviction of his experience, it is important not to get stuck with thinking an insight or idea shouldn't be verbal, or that it should. If you are a narcissist, it is easy to believe you have come to an understanding of yourself by saying \"my experience is always correct, because I say what I think, and do what I want, it must be correct, if other's don't like it, so be it\", and then walk around your whole life hurting others for your own gain, ultimately resulting in you never getting what you truly wanted in the first place. It is also easy to be convinced if you are open-minded and always looking for the new \"approach\" that \"thinking is a mistake, any conclusion I come to in thought is not a true insight because I haven't experienced it\". They are both beliefs, the phenomenon I am pointing to results in an automatic change in perspective that is extremely simple and pragmatic: anything that you experience is true, but it does not make it right or wrong. This isn't consciously processed, it can't be any other way. The truly silent mind is free to think or experience, it is still silent. To judge one form of perception over another is just misunderstanding, and nowadays largely a fashion, and while our world is currently dominated by thought, there is nothing wrong with thought, or insights based on thought, there is nothing wrong with experience, or insight based on experience.

Just as a point of interest, one of the most common beliefs driving an enormous amount of anger and hatred in western culture is the belief there is one big pie of money that we all share, so if someone has more, that means others have less.

The difficulty as I've expressed a bit already is that the only real claim is a bit like saying \"santa claus isn't real, the fear you have of dissapointing him or the anger you have at him because your friend got a better present than you is unfounded. If you inquire into your beliefs about santa claus and completely understand what that entity is, you will find that this will cause your belief in santa claus to end, and your anger and anxiety will too\". If the person says \"what, that's crazy, how are you going to prove to me that santa doesn't exist?\" You're stuck in a very hard position of basically asking \"well, what do you believe Santa is?\" and it's again, a completely subjective phenomenon the person has to do themselves, all I can really do is try to get them to become aware that \"yes, my belief in Santa is definitely causing me problems, but it must also be good in some ways because he brings me presents??\" and I can probe or question their conclusions until they get the hang of it and are able to do it themselves, hence the emphasis on self-enquiry.

I like the metaphor of \"untying a knot\", however the metaphor that has been given before is \"blowing out the flame\" and that is often metaphorically interpreted to mean *the cessation of desire* in buddhism, or something that makes you say \"hmmm yes very cool\", which isn't *wrong* as a metaphor, but I am almost certain that if that phrasing was used by someone it was originally meant to represent what it feels like for about a candle's flame sized part of your brain to realize it's function is a recursion and \"turn off\". It's really just wiping the data because it's an unnecessary duplicate, so it then gets used for other stuff, it's not like part of your brain is literally not meant to be there or is some kind of vestigial organ. It's kinda weird but the best metaphor I can give is it's like removing a huge blackhead from your skin, it \"pops\" out in one go, and there is an empty crater there, but in a few days or weeks you stop feeling it because it gets replaced by skin tissue. It's not like part of your brain mutates or evolves over time or anything, it instantly feels like the electricity stops going to one part of your brain and adds that current to another part of your brain because they were both trying to accomplish the same task and repeatedly interfering with each other. Like I said in the podcast I think it is likely the part of your brain that reconfigures your own memories, which is a like a big hard drive, and then stores it into little purpose built RAM caches of what other people in your life are up to so you can easily recognize and interact with them, and this RAM cache is being accidentally used on yourself until then.","timestamp":"2023-07-17T04:45:51.053000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"384047378128175119","username":"sadnut69","avatar":"c6e6cf4eaab84d909c511cf1f23d76ed","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"SadNut69","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1130349452947886131","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1130241924373168149","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I think this was a good question that you guys might be interested in relationship to good and bad you guys were talking about earlier: https://www.reddit.com/r/StayingInPodcast/comments/1516vh6/collective_consciousness/","timestamp":"2023-07-16T20:57:53.650000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"link","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/StayingInPodcast/comments/1516vh6/collective_consciousness/","title":"r/StayingInPodcast - Collective consciousness","description":"1 vote and 1 comment so far on Reddit","color":16777215,"provider":{"name":"reddit"},"content_scan_version":3}],"pinned":true,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1130241752457027644","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"An internal dialogue is just a form of thinking.

Same thing with \"self-knowledge\", it is ultimately not a self who knows about itself, it is just a self that has knowledge, but it doesn't appear this way because of all the things I've been talking about.","timestamp":"2023-07-16T20:57:12.662000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129886126841282560","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Thanks @hhyyper, I'm pretty familiar with Alan Watts, I really enjoy his work and think he's a good starting place. I mention him in my document I've been working on as a sort of Bill Nye the mystic guy of the subject. I hesitate to recommend him too much too people because he inquires mostly into the mystical, spiritual, and religious side of things and mistakes the phenomenon for the concept for the most part. Very interesting and fun though. To your point about realizing you can't know yourself as object of thought, I want to emphasize that what I'm trying to communicate with others is not \"coming to terms with\" anything or \"if you think this or accept that, then this other state would then hypothetically make sense\" I am not trying to share a theory or way of thinking about things I'm genuinely trying to help others to arrive at what that phenomenon actually is. The realization as to *why* a self-image and the effort to think about yourself is futile is psycho-physiologically transformative because your actual mental processing permanently and automatically changes. I don't communicate in any way the same as a guy like Eckart Tolle, and most people think he's talking about spiritual mumbo jumbo, but I think for others who are interested it is really important to listen to this segment, because while I don't agree with his ideas about the implications and applications of this, it is ultimately the same phenomenon I am trying to communicate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUKDuVRY_D8","timestamp":"2023-07-15T21:24:04.908000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"215955082066395148","username":"hhyyper","avatar":"c7d470e4d8a90e54e9a82a1b982a4f14","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"hyper","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"video","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUKDuVRY_D8","title":"Why Did Eckhart Awaken? | Eckhart Tolle","description":"Eckhart describes the adventure in consciousness we all share.\n\nSubscribe to find greater fulfillment in life: \nhttp://bit.ly/EckhartYT\n\nWant to watch and hear more of Eckhart's Teachings?

I've had lucid dreams and I understand what you are pointing to, but I'm trying to illustrate that the feeling of freedom and control is also still under the umbrella of the dream. In the same way if you are playing a video game, like Super Mario, and you suddenly level up and experience a whole host of new and freedom inducing powers, you are still just playing Super Mario (I know Mario never levels up in the game I don't know why I am using this character analogy). The new learned powers are still a subset of the video game, they aren't external or introduced in any way. In the same sense what I am pointing to is that your waking state imagination and thought operates the same way. The constant vacillation in thought and belief that modifies our mood and emotions is really just an oscillation within an erroneous and misunderstood structure that is overarching, but we don't realize it is there. Repeating myself, but going from regular dreams to lucid dreams seems like a great change in experience, but it is still just changing the quality of dreams, it isn't waking up or seeing what dreams themselves are.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T09:25:09.485000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-15T09:25:27.734000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"246833676942311424","username":"babybaccribs","avatar":"25b37dd979ab0a7704837122ac86316e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"baby bacc ribs","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129697494658465862","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@babybaccribs I understand, the only thing I'd point to is what is the difference between a lucid dream and a regular dream?

From my own perspective basically all major religions are based upon individuals who energetically tried to communicate self-realization but because their understanding was never transmitted effectively, they all got reduced to \"I don't get it, but tell me what to do\", along with an enormous corpus of cultural and scholarly literature that was thrown in.

I think it's very hard not to be aware that a change has occurred if it has, but the only thing I'd say is the only \"test\" is if you have emotional relationship to thought. If there is no physical danger or physical attraction your mood basically never changes. Because even that is a bit nebulous, it's easier to say do you have emotional relationship to dreams, whether it is regular dreams or nightmares. I think the most relieving thing for myself, having experienced frequent nightmares and often having a mild phobia of sleep in the past, all dreams immediately become either pleasant, helpful, meaningless, or don't occur, but there is no emotional experience in any of them. Ultimately they are just the continuation of thinking absent of other sensory experience, but it is very hard to see it that way if you believe you are a participant in the dreams, which is caused by ego/self-image/self-knowledge.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T08:26:41.398000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129682082906509424","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The problem is most people say \"oh, well I'd say my day today was a 7/10, that's pretty happy, is that me?\" and that's not what is meant.

If you read an annoying tweet and get mad, that is a distortion that has taken place because of your self-image and you are now experiencing something irrational and unnecessary. The reason I am so passionate about this subject is because self-realization is not some psychedelic higher spiritual state like religious or spiritual groups think it is, and it isn't made up religious nonsense like academics think it is, it is absolutely real, but it is a subtle change in psychological function that results in existing constantly without any insecurity at all, meaning your natural state of peace and contentment is permanent unless there is physical disturbance or you hurt someone unintentionally.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T07:53:17.043000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129682081274920960","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@Deleted User I really want to emphasize the self-image actually doesn't operate any more, it's not like ignoring it or putting it to the side.

It doesn't matter what someone says it just doesn't register because of the suppressing effects of the drug. It is somewhat similar to that, in that the experience just doesn't occur like it used to, but not due to repression or avoidance or anything irrational. I don't think it is helpful to try to imagine what the ongoing experience is like because then you make it a goal and try to come up with a way to experience that, which itself is your self-image and takes you further away.

The phenomenon I am describing is the realization that knowledge must always be about something that is not itself, otherwise it would not contain content. If you were truly thinking about yourself, you would be thinking about yourself who is currently thinking, which is like photocopying a blank piece of paper. The realization that self-knowledge was created only to know itself, but it cannot do that, causes the structure to dissolve because you immediately realize it cannot fulfill its funciton in any way. The guy on the left is thinking \"I don't know who I am, I just do whatever\" is based on never bothering to think about themselves despite their repeated problems in life, while the jedi guy says \"I don't know who I am\" because they realize it is not possible for knowledge to do that.

that's great, hopefully it will be helpful to you! Yes you can't force anything it all happens automatically when a certain insight and understanding occurs. The click for me occurred when I was thinking about how you can't actually think about the past or future because you can only think in the present, and all you're really doing is drawing a picture in your mind, labelling it as something, and then believing that label. The thought in particular that clicked it over for me is also one I've heard others have had which was \"ten years ago I was 'me, now', today I am 'me, now', and in ten years I will be 'me, now'. I have never actually ever been anything other than 'me, now'. I can't ever be anything else\".

I hesitate to talk too much about positive emotion because what most people call positive emotion is really the compensatory effect of relieving negative emotion. Feeling happy that it is the weekend for example is really only a thing because it is the end of stressing about your school or work for the last 5 days and now that has ended there is a rebound equilibrium effect that makes you feel very happy. Again I hesitate to say this because it can easily be misinterpreted, but while something like emotional love is seen as absolutely the most important thing in life, happiness or joy is honestly not really very important and largely a misunderstanding of what positive emotion is.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T01:41:52.857000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129586412048629812","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Another example that might make more sense is if you hate a certain politician, the enquiry into why you hate someone starts by saying \"I hate this person, and I have never really investigated why, I am going to find out\" you then write down, think, or talk to yourself out loud about absolutely everything you think about this person. As you are doing so you will realize that certain things you say or believe are irrational or contradictory and your brain will automatically correct them. As you do this for \"who/what am I?\" you will begin to understand who you think you are, and as you witness your own beliefs you become aware of your own internal contradictions and misunderstandings. Eventually you realize that there are fundamentally two completely irreconcilable structures that you believe yourself to be and there is an instant recognition that *something* must be fundamentally wrong about one of the entities. Realizing the error in self-understanding that causes this makes the structure turn in a single, integrated whole. Metaphorically it's like if you have 100 strings, you combine them into 10 braids, you then combine those down to 2 ropes, but then you notice \"huh, I can't put these ones together into one thing, what's going on here?\" Ultimately you realize you are not holding two ropes, you are holding the same rope at each end, mistaking two things for one the whole time, and that is the click moment.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T01:33:07.333000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129586405530681355","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@hhwea You do have to think in order to dissolve the structure, but what you're doing is like untying a knot rather than trying to figure out something new.

Anyone can get it though because it's subtractive, not additive. Most animals for example are very likely in the state I describe because they don't have enough capacity to think, meaning they can't accidentally create a self concept and mistake it for themselves. The main enquiry is \"who/what am I?\" but because of how we have always used thought we don't interpret the question itself correctly. As an example, you exist. Every moment of your life you exist. What is that constant experience? The moment you say \"is it like, my material body and my thoughts or something?\" instantly you are not answering the question, you are trying to get a question correct by assuming the answer is objective, you are not trying to actually realize exactly what you currently believe yourself to be subjectively. What the process of self-enquiry entails is starting off completely acknowledging you don't know, then asking yourself \"what do I think I am?\" then you let yourself talk or think and you get to witness in real time what you actually believe.","timestamp":"2023-07-15T01:33:05.779000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"328673677094682632","username":"hhwea","avatar":"e2b6daf30526bc4f6cc9fa7ba0e81ea5","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"hannah","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_f2267c3ad99c109859d15a592d7afe24","sku_id":"1458472704435945653","expires_at":null},"collectibles":{"nameplate":{"sku_id":"1382845914192023632","asset":"nameplates/nameplates_v3/aurora/","label":"COLLECTIBLES_NAMEPLATES_VOL_3_AURORA_A11Y","palette":"teal"}},"display_name_styles":{"font_id":8,"effect_id":1,"colors":[]},"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129553748251922524","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's ultimately the same structure that causes nightmares, emotional relationship to dreams and the capacity to be angered, insulted, or flattered by other people's opinions.

I also drew this for a segment in the podcast so maybe this might be slightly more helpful at pointing to the entity that stops operating if there is the click I've described.","timestamp":"2023-07-14T23:19:28.413000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1129552778004533379","filename":"1.png","size":444662,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1129343306485215345/1129552778004533379/1.png?ex=69910300&is=698fb180&hm=5fe5b0b517f1e8d1b099616ac52b157026a54a6c3ac0883bcde3695f8c074c43&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1129343306485215345/1129552778004533379/1.png?ex=69910300&is=698fb180&hm=5fe5b0b517f1e8d1b099616ac52b157026a54a6c3ac0883bcde3695f8c074c43&","width":1920,"height":1080,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":3}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129534553095147590","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"","timestamp":"2023-07-14T22:07:03.195000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1129534552822513694","filename":"big_think_2.png","size":248451,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1129343306485215345/1129534552822513694/big_think_2.png?ex=6990f207&is=698fa087&hm=35d5e6d8077d3b684ed770cb865e04362223a66bfa93056638459849f9fbf5c4&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1129343306485215345/1129534552822513694/big_think_2.png?ex=6990f207&is=698fa087&hm=35d5e6d8077d3b684ed770cb865e04362223a66bfa93056638459849f9fbf5c4&","width":1920,"height":1080,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":3}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129532911075475526","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"might be more understandable like this","timestamp":"2023-07-14T22:00:31.707000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-07-14T22:06:34.248000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1129531791133397062","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Hey guys super cool to see y'all discussing.
