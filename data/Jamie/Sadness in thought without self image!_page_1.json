If you imagined a worm or virus you likely would have no emotional relationship.\n\nYou are sad imagining a dead puppy because you think death is bad and something you are worried about happening to you or anything you care about, and/or the puppy you imagined had positive characteristics that made you feel better about yourself, and so its absence caused you to feel you have lost something that you can't get back. \n\nYou can replace the idea of \"I imagined a fake dead puppy, I am sad\" with \"I imagined my crush rejects me and dates someone else. I am sad\". You are upset because you are imagining something that you think makes your life worse. It is exactly the same thing. Both are equally non existent, the emotional relationship to our imagination of the event is an error and is what self-image is.","timestamp":"2025-05-02T17:07:31.766000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-05-02T17:32:22.931000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1366977388172283934","message_id":"1366977388172283934","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
