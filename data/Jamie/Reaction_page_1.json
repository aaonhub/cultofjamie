Self-realization results in only a reaction to what is seen in this case, which means if you see a tree and think \"oh that tree reminds me of my Grandma who died...\" that doesn't cause sadness if it usually would. There is no relationship to an imagined identity. Could be friend, Father, Mother, sibling, etc. \n\nI'm not sure this is necessarily helpful as what I'm responding to is \"Reaction: How does it know what to react to\"\n\nI'm not sure what this particularly means other than small bit of context available","timestamp":"2025-06-18T08:36:33.866000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"551768653402734592","username":"greyandout","avatar":"dc8918ab5cbf0cfbbfd2c3a90f40a018","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"GreyWorm","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"492371812722802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HG","badge":"f44e81e3643194067e800245c2377a89"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"492371812722802688","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"HG","badge":"f44e81e3643194067e800245c2377a89"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1384447645732573244","message_id":"1384447645732573244","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
