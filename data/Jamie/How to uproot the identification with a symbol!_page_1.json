We are then talking as if you are a random ethereal soul about to lock-in to your current body and take on their memories and dreams.\n\nI am going to say to you \"ok, when you're in that body you are going to actually think you had 20, 30, 40 years of past experiences. You didn't, but you are in charge of making decision for that person as if you were, ok?\" \n\nYou then get zapped into your present body and immediately say that your life or emotions are this/that way because of past experiences. I then shake you by the shoulders and say \"Yo, we just talked about this, you haven't experience anything, it's in the memories of the person, you have no relationship to that. Your job is to act intelligently *now*\". \n\nThis is what we are, but the confusion we have is because there seems to be time based continuity that we call \"my life\" that is of many years of duration. You might say \"yeah but it's different because I did experience the past\" and I'm saying \"no, you didn't experience the past, exactly like being zapped into the human you only have memory of the past. That is the past. There actually is no past\".","timestamp":"2025-12-07T10:40:38.015000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1084919931419770931","username":"j41r7642","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"J41R","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1442103055322447943","message_id":"1444246230019473540","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
