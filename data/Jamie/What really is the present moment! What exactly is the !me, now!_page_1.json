In the dream, you are fighting a monster. In your perception there is \"Me\" who is being attacked, and there is \"the monster\" who is attacking you. This seems to make perfect sense. Then when you wake up you immediately say \"ah, lol, not real, it was just a dream\". This previous categorization of \"me vs. them\" or \"me and the world\" instantly collapses into \"The dream\" which is perceived as a single object like a movie you experienced. What I'm suggesting is that all of your experience, even waking, can be perceived as a single object, rather than \"me being affected by the external thing\".","timestamp":"2025-03-03T09:35:10.694000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1331329109833420881","message_id":"1337121371683291178","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":17,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1336630356874367049","channel_id":"1331329109833420881","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I'm not really understanding your point to be honest, if you'd like to add more or respond I'd be happy to reply. I am suggesting that conscious experience is one thing, it exists alone as \"that which I am presently aware of\". If you are suggesting that there is another more appealing alternative, then feel free to argue it if you'd like. What I'm suggesting is not an intellectual understanding, but a personal one, although again I'd be happy to hear where you are coming from. \n\nMy view is no different than \"it's just a bunch of atoms bouncing around\". My view is not incompatible with the materialist view that the universe is just an information system. I feel it's probably also just a small point to mention that \n\n*How can it be everything and only one thing at the same time? It *sounds like a *terrible reductionist logic to collapse experience into *one property. *\n\nThis is what what conventional physics is trying to do, what religious people do, what subjectivists do, etc. I think it is a mischaracterization of what I'm trying to convey, but I'm not sure what you are suggesting is the more rational alternative when every discipline is trying to unify everything into a single entity. \n\n*How is your assertion that all I experience all the time is just one thing different from telling a blind person that all he/she/they see all the time is black and expect that to make sense to them?*\n\nIt's completely different because a blind person experiences way more than just empty vision. They could immediately say \"yeah I also experience a ton of other stuff\". If you say \"I don't just experience sight, I also experience hearing!\" It's like yeah cool dude, that's part of immediate conscious experience. What I'm saying that must be examined is that the things that you don't think are \"present experience\" like memories of the past or imagination of the future are actually just more present experience.","timestamp":"2025-02-05T09:31:50.470000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-02-05T09:33:12.499000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"589819099090255894","username":"cyu3281","avatar":"adeb6222dd06ae9c5fefa05b91054d97","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Steam","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1331329109833420881","message_id":"1335855337634529371","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":14,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1334835276815536180","channel_id":"1331329109833420881","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It is absolutely everything you experience and the only thing you experience, all the time.
