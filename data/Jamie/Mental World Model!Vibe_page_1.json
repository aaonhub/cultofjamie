If you think the world and your life is irreconcilably bad, then you are sad. If you think the world is unjust, then you are angry. If the world is tetering on irreversible and dangerous change, then you are anxious. \n\nIf you have no beliefs at all, then you are at peace and happy. \n\nSelf-realization causes a permanent state of contentment or happiness not because you see the world \"correctly\" or positively, but because you see the world exactly as it is, which is without characterization.\n\nThe reason many of us are happy as children is because we are unknowledgeable and therefore don't have beliefs about ourself that can be contradicted or harmed by external beliefs or ideas. \n\nA lot of what you're describing can be inquired into further by observing that your mood was dictated as a child by \"what you thought was important to 'Me'\" and how that was very shallow and simple, but now it is more complex, and most of us view that \"me\" as flawed, hurt, and hard to resolve positively in our world.","timestamp":"2025-08-13T09:37:37.373000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"707458462090526790","username":"garphwarrior","avatar":"7cc31b26f8247a98c4c21d5d40382616","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"PureSlidery","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1380099085154910228","message_id":"1380099085154910228","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
