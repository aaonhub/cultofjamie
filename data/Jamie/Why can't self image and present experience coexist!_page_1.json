It is functionally similar however to running Windows 11 and *also* running Windows 10. It is actually physically analogous as well, as your self-image starts at a very young age when you learn the word \"Me\", conceptualize it as yourself, and then start building a snowball of beliefs about it over your life. \n\nWhat is physically happening is you have one set of psychological reactions that respond to immediately what you perceive in the environment around you, and another set of psychological reactions that interpret what you are perceiving through the lens of belief and react to that as well. \n\nThis sounds logical, but what is not understood until after self-realization is that the first set of psychological reactions that respond to what you perceive in the environment *includes* your own thoughts already. Your thoughts are actually part of the present environment and exist *only* right now as your perceive them. We don't typically believe this however, and because we think thoughts encompass duration (past and future) and have a sense of volume (like a library or hard drive) we respond to our imagination twice.","timestamp":"2025-09-09T22:42:30.836000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1380310269409886338","message_id":"1385381995013734452","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":38,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1395886785199997049","channel_id":"1380310269409886338","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> What?
