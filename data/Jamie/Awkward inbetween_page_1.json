More specifically, self-image or ego is not even the desire to be loved, as it is not possible to know if another has love for you, it is actually the psychological effort to love your own imagination of yourself. \n\nThe root of the resolution of this is not to say \"oh, that's bad, I don't want to do that, I want to get rid of that, that seems selfish and imperfect\" as that itself is exactly the ego operating. The desire to act and think rightly is itself the effort to change your behaviour or ideas so you can think highly of yourself and is itself the ego/self-image. \n\nWhat needs to be examined instead, is not how to think/act rightly, but to realize and observe the fact that it is actually *impossible* to psychologically conceptualize or evaluate yourself without measurement and comparison to an imagined past or future \"Me\". The key is realizing not just that there is no real past or future self, but that you literally do not ever experience anything other than \"Me, now\" and an imagined past or future have absolutely no connection to your only identity, which is the experience of exactly what you currently are. \n\nWhile it is not readily understood, self-realization occurs when the brain realizes not that it is harmful to criticize and try to change yourself, but the only reality is that it is impossible to change yourself, as the only thing that is real is *exactly* what you are currently are and experience. Ironically, this results in the end of this neuroticism, as our constant discontent with ourselves and our lives is not because our lives are objectively good or bad, but we have invented a demand for our lives to be different, and this demand creates the emotion. Self-realization is essentially the visceral realization that at any point in time, which is *all* time, your life cannot actually be different than it is.","timestamp":"2025-09-10T00:02:09.758000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1410437495052828794","message_id":"1410437495052828794","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":21,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
