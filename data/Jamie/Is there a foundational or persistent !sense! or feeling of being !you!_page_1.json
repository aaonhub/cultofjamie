Thinking is essentially a reconfiguration of memory, which is itself previously observed sensory information. The confusion largely stems from the fact that sensory information that we've observed before is stored in memory, and that seems to create a natural illusion that, like a stack of pancakes, the bottom pancake was there *before* the top pancake. This is eventually resolved through the observation, just like a computer, that memory is only *exactly as it currently is* and that your hard drive is just a present configuration of physical information, it doesn't have duration, but to us this is not immediately intuitive. If you have a photograph from 10 years ago and a photograph from a month ago, you would say \"yeah the 10 year old one is from way before this one\" but it is not true. They are both physical objects that only exist in the present, but the way that you label and perceive them is different. Any human who doesn't have your current memory will just see two pictures in the present and be unable to determine which is older. A duck or cow cannot conceptualize any photo and will see both as pieces of paper they want to eat. You instead see your own memory and interpret a time value that does not actually exist in the objects, but deeply appears to you because of our misunderstanding of personal memory and thought. \n\nIn this example, the cow and duck have no self-image in relationship to your photo, another person has no relationship, but you do because there is recognition of an imagined self-identity in this object/photo.","timestamp":"2025-03-19T03:27:23.436000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-03-19T03:29:05.356000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1345594713754964029","message_id":"1346502489972674711","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1351757282886549524","channel_id":"1345594713754964029","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I would probably use the computer analogy and say that the body and brain of a human being is like the computer and monitor of a pc setup. The element that is \"Me\" is the signal that is being generated from it's processing and computation. When I say \"yeah I like banana ice cream and not cilantro\" I am only aware of the signal, but I know (as part of the signal) it is a computed property of the body that is expressing that. This goes back to \"you aren't Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom, you are the awareness of Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom\". When Mario thinks some existential thoughts, it's still just speech bubbles in the video game and is part of its programming, there is nothing external, separate, or profound. It's just Mario being Mario and is constrained by the programming and characteristics of Mario. \n\nIf for example I wasn't a human and was instead a bear, I'd be like \"yeah not a big fan of cilantro, but love salmon\". This seems obvious when we are talking about \"bears like salmon\" and \"humans like ice-cream\" but suddenly when we ask a question like \"what is the hardest thing you've ever achieved?\" Suddenly it isn't \"bears and humans\" it is *My* achievement. This is a false identification that is truly as trivial as what flavour of jolly rancher you prefer.","timestamp":"2025-03-19T03:20:50.676000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1345594713754964029","message_id":"1346137480256028702","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1346087584044154891","channel_id":"1345594713754964029","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Maybe just to add to the above, the reason it is tied to self-image is because it is mistaking yourself for the character being played.\n\nThe basis of it in us as humans is the belief that \"I am coming up with all of my thoughts and ideas\" when it is really (to use the aforementioned) Link coming up with them. You can't think the thoughts that my brain comes up with, you can only think the thoughts that your brain comes up with. To think those thoughts are \"yeah I did that\" is ridiculous because they're created by the particular machinery that is your body/brain. \n\nAs an example directly to your point, preferences are the best example. I for example really don't like cilantro. It's apparently a thing some percent of people don't like genetically. This is *not* my conscious decision, I just eat it and don't like it. This is how thinking works as well, but most of us don't realize it. \n\nFrom my own perspective, when I speak to you and express my opinion, the only change is that there is an automatic awareness that it's not *me* telling you what I think, it's the human being that I am synthesizing ideas and relaying it to you. To some degree I am watching myself express my ideas not knowing what's next in the same way a third party would look as well.","timestamp":"2025-03-03T11:51:29.134000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1345594713754964029","message_id":"1345642209902461018","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"jamie0773"},{"id":"1346083797711458414","channel_id":"1345594713754964029","author":{"id":"414288504550588438","username":"jamie0773","avatar":"883e1b28bd08036a951bf1bedd781e87","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jamie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"The only sense of \"being\" is the awareness of what the human you are is experiencing, and you are commensurate with that. You're familiar with it, but it is the difference between \"I am Mario experiencing the video game\" vs. \"I am aware of what Mario is experiencing in the video game\". \n\nThere is no true sense of \"Me\" in that there is an object to identify with. This is the origin of the \"there is no self\" in that there is really fundamentally nothing to grasp onto and call your \"true self\" at all. You do however exist, but there is no object to point to as yourself. Again, it isn't magical, it is the same as when everyone plays Zelda, we all play as Link, have our own experience, but we don't \"I am Link\", we say \"I played as Link\". It is sort of like that, just without outside information.","timestamp":"2025-03-03T11:36:26.402000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1345594713754964029","message_id":"1345594713754964029","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
