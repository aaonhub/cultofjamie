The communication of self-realization is about drawing a circle of knowledge around a well that says \"The answer is here, between the lines. Here are a bunch of things that aren't the answer\". Unfortunately the only way to communicate it at all is to basically stand in the way when someone goes the wrong direction and turn them around, you can't point directly to the realization.","timestamp":"2024-07-16T05:16:41.982000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1008171159113699399","username":"randy_dev","avatar":"50e6c5e16ebad18fc3a65e70b9b4fb58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"randy","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1260822130522718288","message_id":"1260822130522718288","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
