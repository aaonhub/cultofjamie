One was resolving a large cluster of beliefs around personal achievement I thought I had to reach. That was partial and had some emotional relief, but the second piece was a complete disintegration of emotional relationship to imagination, dreams, and a self-identity and has been my ongoing experience since.  From my current perspective, the latter made the former seem insignificant and is what I perceive currently as \"complete\" in a way. From my current pov, the whole phenomenon is \"the cessation of the brain seeing utility in a self-identity, past, or future\", and then there is corresponding change in function. The first relief or partial realization for me was very valuable, but still in the framework of an ongoing self-image. It was just helpful but not something transformative. I don't know how this will play out for others. There is no reason some people wouldn't have 15 incremental realizations or ideas on their way to the same place, or get it all at once.","timestamp":"2025-03-03T10:06:00.789000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1336940027506065499","message_id":"1336940027506065499","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"jamie0773"}]
