Being aware is effortless because you're always presently aware, \"improving awareness\" is itself the idea of effort which separates the present into the future. Awareness is not presently aware of \"improving awareness\", because that is an ideal in the future, not the present. There are thoughts about improving awareness, but those are also occurring presently in awareness itself. Being aware is simply not overlooking what you are already experiencing. Essentially, giving priority to what you already are, in spite of thoughts that try to convince you otherwise.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1331153382278172755/1331291789855948875","timestamp":"2025-02-01T08:59:43.893000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"_diaso_"}]
