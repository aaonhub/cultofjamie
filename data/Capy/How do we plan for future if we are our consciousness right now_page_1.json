You're confusing the map for the territory because you cannot ever actually experience rain in the future.\n\nThe way you make plans about the future is the same way you always have, by thinking. The future is a plan you make in the present moment. Always has been. If you're experiencing the future, you're not actually in the future, because you would be currently experiencing that.","timestamp":"2024-09-03T18:47:56.762000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-09-03T18:50:44.709000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1270613843810324512","username":"yournamehere2","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Yournamehere910","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1280392091213496373","message_id":"1280392091213496373","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"_diaso_"}]
