Stick to what is already the case or inherent to your experience. Look for what is unchanging in experience. Before you think about changing yourself or saving the world or whatever, first figure out what is actually real and true and doesn't change. You can listen to Jamie or other gurus for advice, but if something isn't in your experience and you're trying to make it that way because \"someone else said so\", that's just an ideal which will \"vanish\" as soon as you meditate lol. Meditation is great for grounding for that reason.\n\nMuch of the thoughts and problems are about trying to do things or change things, but this overlooks \"the truth\" which is what is actually the case. Ok, you have ideas about yourself, emotions, whatever, but what is actually true and experienced which doesn't require time or effort? What is already here?","timestamp":"2025-03-17T18:21:20.129000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1345838340347269283","message_id":"1348525092220702761","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"_diaso_"}]
