Not a single thing you can think of is left out of experience, because you're experiencing thinking it. Thus there is no such thing as dividing experience into objects, as there is nothing in experience which can divide experience since it would also have to be experienced.\n\nVery simply, there aren't two components to pointing or representing. Either something is being represented, or it isn't. There's no such thing as \"something outside the representation\" because then there is no representation for something to be outside of.\n\nDistinctions are like mental fingers. They are never what they point at, they only consist of pointing. All distinctions are symbols because they refer to parts of experience and you only experience all of experience (otherwise it isn't experienced). Experience has no modality of separating itself, it only uses itself to point to itself, which is all still part of itself; being the one undivided thing that it is.\n\nThe finger and what the finger points at are the same occurrence. You can't have one without the other.\n\nAs an example, hammers don't represent hammers.\n\nSo when you say \"this is a hammer\"...\n\nThere is no \"this\" which is being a hammer, that's the pointer which isn't a hammer (like a hand which points to a hammer isn't a hammer, it's a hand). There's just the hammer. One thing. Not two things. There isn't something separate from the hammer which is being a hammer.\n\nFleshing it out further, there isn’t any part of experience being another part of experience. All words point to one thing, which is just your experience now. So there really is nothing other than experience which you can use to point at the experience, that is why you have to use parts of experience (words, fingers, thoughts) to point, otherwise the distinction would be self-evident and there would be no need for symbols to represent anything.","timestamp":"2024-08-21T00:25:13.618000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-08-21T00:34:04.648000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1275568586542288896","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":18,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1275226738124918785","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"all objects are links between objects. that's how you make the distinction in the first place. \"car\" denotes objects that arent cars. \n\ncars dont describe cars, only the word \"car\" does. a symbol only describes things, it is never the thing itself. but the catch is that there is nothing to describe without the description either.","timestamp":"2024-08-19T22:55:46.936000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-08-19T22:56:35.164000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1275195736589598831","message_id":"1275218746096619601","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1275208825150115850","channel_id":"1275195736589598831","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Yeah so we know that schematics aren't cars, and that the words in a dictionary aren't the actual things (the word cat isn't a cat), so the thoughts create a \"bridge\" by imagining the distinctions even though the distinctions don't exist outside it.\n\nRepresentations are never the thing they represent, but if you take the representation away, nothing is being represented anymore.
