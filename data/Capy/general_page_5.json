I want very badly for this divison and conflict to end but I don't know how to do it\n\nThere is no \"how\" because \"how\" is thought. \"How\" is the division, it is the idea that there is somewhere else to reach through some method.\n\nAbsence of division is the opposite of division. Therefore, there is no \"doing\" required, only an undoing. There is nothing for you to do other than just not engaging with thoughts about division. Being undivided is the natural state. There are only thoughts about being divided, but you are never in them, and so they eventually vanish.\n\n> I want to fix this misunderstanding, that I carry with me, about myself\n\nMisunderstanding is the thought that you can carry misunderstanding. Unicorns couldn't misunderstand anything, since they are imagined or thought of. Same goes for you. \n\nAbsence of misunderstanding is understanding, so there is only an \"undoing\" required, not any \"how\" or \"doing.\"  \n\nTrying to understand unicorns is just more misunderstanding, because it is in thought. There is nothing to understand because there is nothing in thought, and there is no such sense perception as \"misunderstanding\" outside of thought.\n\n> I hope to stumble upon some thought that could cause a click\n\nThoughts couldn't cause a click, or anything for that matter. Thoughts about causes aren't actually causes, they're just thoughts. Try to find a cause for your experience, without thinking. Which sense perception is a cause going to be made of?","timestamp":"2024-04-28T04:48:40.721000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-28T04:49:13.725000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1233986412085383243","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1233865353172484177","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Thoughts communicate but dont really describe anything outside of itself. I think this is very important to get.\n\nThoughts point at things like a finger does. But actually the finger and the thing being pointed at are the same occurrence. There aren't \"things\" until thought points to it, and so things are literally thought. The finger is never what it points to. Same goes for thought. So notice that the thing that the thought points to vanishes once the thought is gone. \n\nThoughts seem to \"hone in\" or \"cut out\" certain parts of experience. But a thought couldn't ever actually do this, because it is just a thought. Whatever the thought points to disappears with the thought because it is the thought. \n\nYou say you're looking at a table, but that is just the thought pointing. Your experience has more things than a table. And so you couldn't experience \"table\", just the thought of it.","timestamp":"2024-04-27T19:40:24.306000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1233842519695950005","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"no, from watching it appear and disappear","timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:09:40.381000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"814015783881408522","username":".geode","avatar":"62293841c2129d29e9a6dd06f6a6328c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Geode","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1233842191814885426","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1233841917318533251","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"figure out how thoughts create your reality, by doing that","timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:07:16.763000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"814015783881408522","username":".geode","avatar":"62293841c2129d29e9a6dd06f6a6328c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":128,"flags":128,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Geode","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1233773943090057266","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1233840569281675334","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"yeah pretty much. big ramifications","timestamp":"2024-04-27T18:01:55.366000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1226568706394554448","username":"wayofkings333","avatar":"a22a44476e3645e572e96b0f9be5788e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jay","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1233775906292629626","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1233712023146336276","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Watching thoughts appear and disappear.

Mind often obscures or hides feeling by creating cause/reason for feeling, like \"this feeling is caused by yesterday or tomorrow.\"","timestamp":"2024-04-22T21:10:41.832000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-22T21:11:51.858000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"118137828776476679","username":"rabidmice","avatar":"e036672d78a018170d7d2c92c0f79d9a","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jellydog","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1232018956986875905","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1232073672475541574","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> where does my personality come from?\n\nWherever it comes from would be ***thoughts about*** personality.\n\nLike asking \"where does the taste of vanilla come from?\"\n\n> My understanding is that I am an entity that has the ability to think which mistakes myself for being in thought.\n\nThis itself is thought.

There is no \"being inside of thought\", that only exists for an imaginary entity, like unicorns. There is only the awareness of a thought, and then the further thoughts/assumptions about it which you become aware of.

Meaning, personality is not \"yours\" (how could someone be separate from a personality?), and it is not separate from experience. Whatever is imagined is just imagined and experienced as imagination, period. \n\nIf \"my personality\" is taken as a genuine occurrence, that means you believe your experience is split in two, which could not be the case. We have to be careful, because the thought \"my personality\" is not what personality is.","timestamp":"2024-04-22T21:00:54.340000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-23T03:38:45.489000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"210575654524026880","username":"dimefox.","avatar":"11af762583dd387f7fcdc219e76efbf2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"dime","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1231933607182864445","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1232070909091909663","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"it

It always feels that way when people try to put things in stages. And the stages are simply just maps, they couldn't ever reflect what is true anyways. Why point to maps when you can point to what is true? Stages are just extra ideas. If you want a good summary of stages (prior to SR and somewhat after), Ox Herding Pictures are best IMO.\n\n\"Self-realization\" is not a precursor to anything so there is no second, third, etc. It's like realizing you forgot your keys or something. There are no stages to something like that, because stages are duality. Can it affect how you want to live your life or something? Sure. That's just life though, not self-realization. Any stages only make sense to me if they come before SR, otherwise what is being described is really not directly related to SR. \n\nHow could you partially \"embrace\" non-duality?

Neither could a desire, or worry, etc. Because all of them are about things that haven't occurred yet, AKA nothing. There could only be the appearance or assumption of those things and how they feel. Being threatened is how assumptions feel. The idea of a future is an assumption. Assumptions and futures always only ever appear as thought/imagination, currently. \n\nThere is no correct answer/reasoning/cause which would \"solve\" what you are imagining, because that would have to be in the imagination. The appearance of pain stops when you let go of a hot stove. The appearance of worry/imagination stops when you let go of it. There is nothing further to it. The imagination is like a self-contained dream. It appears as a problem, until it stops appearing. Being chased by a murderer in a dream is a problem for someone inside a dream. Worrying about the future is a problem for someone in the future. Realizing that the dream is a dream is the solution, not fighting the murderer. Realizing that the future is imagination is the solution, not figuring out what to do about the future. \n﻿\nIn order to see your situation clearly, write down or bring up all the thoughts about what you do not want. Everything that feels bad. Then bring up the opposite of those, which is what you do want. What you do not want always illuminates what you do want since you just have to look at the opposite side of it. \n\nThinking of what you don't want is the same as being what you don't want, and feels like that.\n\nThinking of what you want is being what you do want, and feels like that.\n\nWhat does thinking about what you want create? What does thinking about what you don't want create?

Cause is explanation or relation.\n\nIf you believe you are inside of the cause/reasoning/thought which appears, it could seem like you are in a world which is caused by things.\n\nCause is a relationship between two things, like cause and effect. If A does not exist then B could not. It is a relationship between two things, first and foremost, inferred through mind. A division.\n\nCause is reasoning which comes after the fact of experience. You flip on a light switch, light appears, mind reasons afterwards: the light is caused by flipping the switch. But this reasoning doesn't really speak to experience, because there is nothing other than your own experience which could cause an experience. Light is not the experience of a switch being flipped. A switch being flipped is not the experience of light. Mind \"glues\" the two experiences together and creates a cause. The cause is an explanation for what you are currently experiencing, it is not what occurs but an explanation for what occurs. If I wiped your memory, you would forget what caused the light to occur because it is not actually in experience, only the end result (light) is. Cause is never experienced outside of itself, cause is always an explanation for what is experienced. It is logic, division, mind, intellect.\n\nExperience could not be aware of something that causes experience, because it would have to be experienced.\n\nIt is like playing Minecraft and saying \"this game is caused by code.\" Code is not experienced during the game because that is not what the game is.

Try to find what is causing the thought in your experience, and notice how the thought is not caused by anyone or anything. Similar to how the cause of dreaming could not really be found within the appearance of the dream, or anywhere for that matter.\n\nNotice how the thought appears as something, either you, or tomorrow, or some idea, and how it vanishes like a dream. It has this quality of settling down after a while. Become very accustomed and watchful to this quality, and how the different thoughts feel, and what it implies about you and your experience.\n\nNotice how the thought continually appears as the world, as people, as you, as reality, as explanations about reality, and this, and that. And how it just vanishes, like a dream. And you are the one viewing and perceiving all of it, but you are never inside of it, since you can't be inside what you perceive. You are the viewer, not the one in what is being viewed, ever.","timestamp":"2024-04-16T02:51:55.330000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-16T02:52:05.630000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1229623792800895067","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1229623726820167740","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"is

When you grasp that then you \"move out of\" thought. Because all that happens is what is being felt currently.\n\nWhat I'm saying right now doesn't \"become untrue\" after SR, because all I am saying is that emotions are felt currently, and it is true that things are always felt currently. Emotions are true. Thought rationalizes emotions and tries to turn the emotion into a thought like \"my emotion comes from yesterday, tomorrow, this, that, etc.\"\n\nIf I'm not experiencing something it doesn't mean you're not experiencing something. I am communicating based on what you are asking about your experience. It's more like I'm describing the weather yesterday. I'm not saying it is occurring to me, I'm just saying how it occurs and that the same weather might be occurring to you right now.\n\nTo put it succinctly, I'm describing how emotions and thoughts are misperceived prior to SR. That mechanism doesn't \"vanish\" or \"become untrue\" after SR, but the mechanism is acting maladaptively because you believe you are in the thought.\n\nYou weren't ever actually inside of your thoughts prior to SR, so you never actually contradict SR. You simply think it. Thinking is not the same as existing or being as that thing. It is not untrue that your thoughts feel bad currently. It is untrue that you are in the thought. When you stop \"being in the thought\", you stop feeling bad currently, so they are linked in that way.","timestamp":"2024-04-09T21:49:31.742000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"339877696957972491","username":"xav9999","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Xäv","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1227369956115615744","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1227354040581623939","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"both

Emotion and thought is not caused by something 7 years ago, it occurs right now without a cause other than what is occurring right now. The emotion is not caused by any reason other than the thought occurring right now, and any reason explaining how the thought feels would simply be another thought.\n\nThe pain from a hot stove occurs because you are touching it right now, not because someone decided to build the stove 7 years ago.

If the pain from the stove is caused by something 7 years ago, then you cannot travel back 7 years to stop it from being built, and so you continue to keep your hand on the stove, unless you realize that the entire thing is one occurrence in the present moment.

Emotion is the thought.\n\nSelf-referencing (thoughts about self) can feel very emotionally powerful; like disgust or regret. Emotional guidance is felt accordingly in regards to thoughts about things that aren’t you but are believed to be you. \n\nRegret is not caused by 7 years of actions because thoughts are not caused by 7 years of actions. Thought occurs now without any action. The \"cause\" of thought, is just more thought, and thus not actually a cause at all, just a thought about cause. Inspect direct experience to verify. \n\nRegret is being the thought that there are “7 years of actions.” But what is being thought cannot be in thought. \n\nYou are being the thought, you are not being in the thought. You are not being 7 years right now, you are being the thought of 7 years, right now. \n\nRegret is the desire to change what you did in the past. But that splits you into two (past and future). There can’t be you in the past which regrets being there, there is you being a thought about the past.\n\nEmotions guide you away from being in the thought. Like how pain guides you away from touching a hot stove. The guidance of emotions is often obscured by reasonings like \"I'm feeling this because of what happened 7 years ago\" which is actually how the thought feels right now, it is not how 7 years feels like.\n\nEmotions are desires created by the thought which can be further inspected and dispelled. In this case, regret is a desire to change what you did in the past, which is the same as the thought \"I am in the past.\" The desire is ultimately to just be with yourself, currently.\n\nThought creates an \"extra self\" by claiming that you are in the thought, as in \"I did this 7 years ago.\" But whatever claims or perceives that cannot be in the claim or perception. Inspect direct experience to verify.","timestamp":"2024-04-07T20:33:53.378000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1225941379801415831","username":"spacey_cowboy12","avatar":"83283daf2e52f0c6e5d85d23b6a9d24e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Spacey_Cowboy12","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1226362873719291914","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1226303370235744399","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You are always only ever being \"senses.\" \n\nIntellect on intellect is believing that you are experiencing whatever the thought proposes, but the thought is also perceived through senses the same way any other perception is.\n\n\"Senses\" can appear as a thought that you are inside of your intellect. Thought is a sense which can turn into a statement about \"me being inside of thought.\"\n\nExamples of thoughts appearing as you inside of it: \"I have work tomorrow, I did this yesterday, I am experiencing myself inside of a world made of atoms, etc.\"\n\nIntellect/thought is made of separations and self-referential statements, like \"I, me, this, that, etc\"  which \"places you\" inside of the thought.\n\nSenses can appear as thought but can't be inside of thought. The thing viewing thought cannot be in thought. There can only be a thought \"I am inside of this thought\", which senses appear as.\n\nSenses cannot say \"my experience of the color red is made out of receptors and atoms bouncing here and there\", sense can only sense red.

is as simple as reading a story, getting lost in the story, and then realizing that you are not experiencing the story aside from your thoughts about it.\n\nAll that needs to be noticed is that the emotion is caused by the thought itself, not contents of thought. The content holds zero weight. Meaning, you aren't in the content of thought, you are experiencing how the thought feels to look at. \n\nYou cant be stressed about work tomorrow, stress is how the thought \"i have work tomorrow\" feels. The emotion comes prior to tomorrow therefore it cant be caused by tomorrow therefore you don't feel tomorrow, you feel emotion and thought currently. It's like touching a hot stove and going \"my hand burns because i have to use the stove tomorrow.\" The logic and reasoning veils and obscures the guidance created by emotions and feeling. Pain guides you away from the stove. Anxiety guides you away from the thought.\n\nThe emotions are real and they make it feel real. But that is just how the thought feels, currently. Explaining or rationalizing the emotion obscures what is presently occurring, for example \"i feel anxiety because I have work tomorrow\" blames \"tomorrow\" as the cause of the emotion, even though tomorrow has not occurred yet. The thought and emotion is not caused by work tomorrow because it comes prior to tomorrow. It is purely the interaction you're having with the thought. \n\nIt is as simple as seeing \"tomorrow is not happening right now, thought and emotion is, therefore I cant be worried about tomorrow, I can only experience how the idea of tomorrow feels.\" It is as simple as checking direct experience and seeing that the contents of your thought don't exist once you stop thinking them. There is no tomorrow when you stop thinking about it. There is no story from a book when you stop thinking about it. There is no emotional reaction to tomorrow when you stop thinking about it. There is no emotional reaction to a book when you stop thinking about it.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T19:04:32.619000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-05T19:41:08.723000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1225728370520756264","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1225681794918252617","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Noticing self-referential thoughts is all that needs to be done.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T05:41:51.975000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1225681565200416798","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"There is nothing you can do wrong, there is just the thought that \"you are doing something wrong\", which can be felt and examined and reduced to thought.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T05:40:57.206000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"454699891529351168","username":"wtfaustin","avatar":"e315eb3bee21232da4ef31f5d8a3bc0f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Austin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1225669555922272327","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1225671608954392696","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":">  I feel like idk wtf I’m doing.\n\nThe thought \"i dont know wtf im doing\" feels a certain way. \n\nThat is how the thought feels.
