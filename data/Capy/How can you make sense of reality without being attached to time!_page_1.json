Like how dreams are self-contained.\n\nyou can imagine being in a dream and that if you tried to find what produces the dream it would only cause you to create a model of the dream (example: maybe my brain or god is creating the dream), but that is the dream. Similarly, the brain seems like an attempt to find a producer of reality but that would have to be reality as well. This recursion happens because it's overlooked that there is really simply just one experience or one reality where everything happens. It's like trying to get actors on a theatre stage to display what is creating the stage.\n\nthere isn't \"perceiving later\" or \"perceiving in the past\". Now or never. if it's not happening alongside everything else, then it isn't.","timestamp":"2024-10-15T22:04:22.397000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"617160836083089427","username":"steamedhams4974","avatar":"2fd24eb46640f2e5813dadbf3c8fb6b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"steamed hams","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_b9f89cd88eabf437777bf35f55e6126f","sku_id":"1402472280642289775","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"185590609631903755","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"Ыend","badge":"3e1695b59c9f89e89258e7c42cc4ef5e"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1288301671910477844","message_id":"1295433217133903893","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":27,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1292657111880433744","channel_id":"1288301671910477844","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It seems like a lot of false equivalencies are being made on your part. For example, I never said reality was random. You don't have to go down that rabbit hole of deducting whether reality is random or not. That's just more thinking and theorizing. \n\nWhat is being pointed to is the simplest and most obvious thing there is, your current experience, which is the only thing you ever experience.\n\nThinking is really like drawing on a whiteboard in real time. Or reading a book in real time. There aren't divisions in the book or whiteboard. There's one whiteboard and one book.
