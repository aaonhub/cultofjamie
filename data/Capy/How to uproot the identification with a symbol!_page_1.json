So where is the singular entity (ex: you or life) that you are talking about? Can it be found?\n\nWhich is all just to say...\n\nIn the spirit of being as direct as possible, is it possible to experience any of this stuff without you? For example, not \"my mind\", just mind. Not \"my life\", just life.\n\nIf you say it is not possible, then why is that? Why are you so necessary to these perceptions? And can they even exist without your relation to them?","timestamp":"2025-11-29T19:42:33.700000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-11-29T19:42:59.899000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1084919931419770931","username":"j41r7642","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"J41R","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1442103055322447943","message_id":"1444246230019473540","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1443225066082144449","channel_id":"1442103055322447943","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> Am I on the right track?\n\nYeah.
