So why do you think you can? Because it might appear for you in the future? \n\nIf you're not seeing something, you can only assume that you will see it at some other point. But where's that \"you\" which is at some other point? And, what other point?\n\nThe belief is what you're adding on top of what you're already experiencing. It's not a matter of looking for something that dispels the belief, it's looking at what your belief ***is*** that makes you think that you can see something that isn't there.\n\nSomeone who believes in Santa could also use this time component to extrapolate their belief. Maybe they're not experiencing Santa because they haven't searched hard enough? Maybe they'll find Santa in the future? Maybe they just need to wait a bit longer? You're searching for it ***because*** it isn't there ***already.***\n\nIn experience, it's already obvious that there isn't Santa. It's the thoughts which aren't experienced that you're adding on top of experience, which perpetuates the belief. Otherwise, experience is self-evident. Thoughts aren't self-evident, because they conceptually extrapolate into the future, which ***never is***, ***by design.*** It's like constantly trying to get the perfect weather prediction - it makes no sense. \n\nOtherwise, your experience is quite clear about it. It isn't there, you're the one assuming that it is, hence the search. You don't search for something if it's already in your experience, you search for it because you assume it exists somewhere else. This assumption is the thought you recognize yourself in. \n\nBecause there is only current experience, the fact of experience is that it isn't there, but you are imagining yourself in a future where it is there. You've created a concept for yourself that perpetuates itself as long as you believe in someone who experiences a future, but you have ***never experienced that.*** \n\nThis is what the entire search is. The search is for the one in the future, that the one which is now never experiences. This is by design, as it actually points to the truth of yourself, that you are always now. Someone who is now couldn't know anything about someone who is not now.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1129343306485215345/1272653565483286538\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1129343306485215345/1273516024934699051","timestamp":"2024-10-30T08:10:01.362000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1301034953126973440","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":18,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1300745703408275507","channel_id":"1299037015114780744","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"its important to notice that you didn't learn more about santa to get rid of him. learning more about santa ensconces you further into the belief. theres no method, knowledge, technique, etc, for getting rid of santa because those would all perpetuate the belief in santa, theres only realizing they arent there because they are a belief. You don't have to go and hunt santa down. a newborn doesnt have to learn or think or gain new knowledge to realize santa isn't there, because santa isn't there.\n\nwhat happened was you gained a piece of knowledge from google maps about santa, and then used it to recognize your experience, like \"i live in a world where santa is real\" and then you replaced that belief with some piece of knowledge or evidence that counteracts it, so now you can recognize yourself in this newly found piece of evidence or knowledge like \"i live in a world where santa doesnt exist because it's actually my parents doing that and I have memories of that etc. etc.\". You are recognizing yourself in knowledge and trying to update your current experience of that knowledge, which is like fighting beliefs with beliefs, which is the basis of self-image. \n\nSimilarly, like learning about santa ensconces you further into santa, trying to refine how you think of yourself ensconces you further into self-image. You can't think of yourself because you can't think of yourself thinking, this is the recursiveness again.\n\nin regards to figuring out the experience of santa, notice that these theories are all models to answer the question \"what am i actually experiencing?\", but they are part of what you are currently experiencing. this present moment \"modelling\" is called \"thinking\".\n\nif you noticed, the \"I\" which is trying to figure out what they are experiencing is actually contained in the question \"what am I actually experiencing?\", and so the question implies that you are trying to recognize your experience of yourself in the thought/knowledge/appearance which is supposed to answer that question. So if you answer \"I'm experiencing santa claus\", you now \"recognize yourself\" in that piece of knowledge which you currently modeled. Like yes, that's me, I am the one experiencing that. This is, again, the recursiveness.\n\nThere isn't a separate \"you\" left behind from the past or future that you have to have knowledge about, the current knowledge models any idea of past or future, currently. There isn't a \"you\" at the effect of the model, as that would be something separate from the model, there is only the model (thinking) currently appearing.\n\n> I don't know if this makes any sense to ask, but what does the self-image supposedly explain that it doesn't actually explain? \n\nThe self-image plays a lose-lose game because it's trying to explain something that simply isn't there.\n\nSelf-image is a recursive thought that refers to a separate self when there is none, which you recognize yourself in. That is the belief. \n\nSelf-image continuously appears as problems, fears, solutions, explanations, etc,*** for*** this separate self ***until*** it is noticed that there isn't a separate self which is separate from the problems, fears, solutions, and explanations which your thoughts are presently appearing as.","timestamp":"2024-10-29T08:59:02.379000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-29T09:03:27.001000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1300259524887711754","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1300194366182395904","channel_id":"1299037015114780744","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"You aren't defining it as something that doesn't exist, though.

What even is the future, in your experience? etc. These questions bring the belief to the limelight for scrutiny, which is what self-inquiry is.\n\nusing the mirror analogy, questioning the belief would be like asking \"why do you think you're inside the mirror?\"\n\nthen you might say something like, \"well it looks like me and mimics me\"\n\nthen you might say \"well that doesn't necessarily mean it is me, does it? and then also, how are there two of me?\"\n\nthen you keep going and you'll realize that all your conclusions are off and don't really land anywhere or define you at any point, which rids you of the belief","timestamp":"2024-10-25T21:44:21.495000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-25T21:56:36.482000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1299482444206051371","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1299196769992839213","channel_id":"1299037015114780744","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"yep, exactly","timestamp":"2024-10-25T02:24:07.875000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1299177929179398238","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1299196747515432981","channel_id":"1299037015114780744","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"It's the thought or belief which is currently appearing which is being felt emotionally.

What is happening is that you are having a thought about the future and you are recognizing yourself in that thought, like looking at a reflection in the mirror, and you are reacting emotionally to it.\n\n\"Me who is worried about the future\" isn't separate from the thought of the future, it is the thought. The thought of the future feels like worry, which is to say, it is identical to worry. And that presently appearing thought, if examined, will show that there is no \"you\" separate from the thought that has to worry about the thought of the future. \n\nYou are essentially creating a recursion in thought. You are thinking of the person who is thinking and then worrying about them, but no one is thinking that thought.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1298618254381809745/1299115115269853194\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1129343306485215345/1298061989129748481","timestamp":"2024-10-25T02:24:02.516000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1299180189325987933","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":5,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1299113780470616095","channel_id":"1299037015114780744","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Beliefs don't exist by definition, so you can't find them anywhere in experience.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1129343306485215345/1275266319931019377\n\nBeliefs are concepts that aren't experienced, just like the concepts of \"tomorrow\" or \"non-existence\". The function of thinking allows you to think of things that you don't experience.\n\nNonetheless, though there aren't beliefs, as in, there isn't what the concept is pointing to, there is how that belief or concept feels presently.\n\nFor example, anxiety is how the belief that you can experience the future feels (fear, presently).\n\nThe fact of the matter is, you think that you are a separate entity that is experiencing the implications of your thoughts (tomorrow, non-existence, etc.). This is the belief which is felt currently, as aversive emotions like fear. The feelings and emotions aren't beliefs, and they aren't caused by beliefs. In the same way that the fear of Santa isn't actually caused by Santa. And in the same way that the fear of tomorrow isn't actually caused by tomorrow, because fear occurs now, not tomorrow.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1129343306485215345/1297680547421884466\n\nThe way for you to dispel the belief is simply to find it. You believe it exists. Where is it? What does it look like? Do you have any memories of it? Bring it to the limelight. First find the belief and figure out what it is before trying to get rid of it. The disillusionment happens naturally when all your attempts at experiencing the belief fail, leading you to recognize that perhaps it doesn't exist at all and that your way of looking at it is mistaken in some way.\n\nIn regards to \"non-psychological fear\", you experience this in various degrees too. It happens exactly like getting startled by a loud sound. It's just your body reacting to your environment, without any need for mental distinguishing. You don't think \"I'm gonna be scared of a loud sound\", you just hear it without any prediction and react to it.","timestamp":"2024-10-24T20:54:21.631000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-24T20:55:31.957000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1031563309759078431","username":"whybyfire","avatar":"a20585552cab5dfdc25f7e91f8947cfd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ishaan","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1076387710173982830","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"JOE","badge":"58271fb362c4464a4ebead69a2ec0f72"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1299037015114780744","message_id":"1299038287440248894","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"_diaso_"}]
