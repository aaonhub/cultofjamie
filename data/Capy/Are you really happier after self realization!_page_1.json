These are conceptualizations of emotions, and all concepts are thoughts. There's only one emotion: what you're feeling now. Because that is part of what you're experiencing now. And there aren't two nows. There's no such thing as what I should and shouldn't feel, because you're already feeling whatever you're feeling.\n\nYou're already feeling emotions without self-image. The self-image doesn't exist because it's a belief; it's what you think of yourself that isn't true. Self-image is in the past or future, but you cant feel past or future. \n\nEmotions aren't believed, they're felt. There's no such feeling as \"tomorrow\" since you only feel now, there's only how that belief feels currently, which we might call as \"anxiety\" or whatever else.\n\nYou're not looking to change what you're currently experiencing, you're looking to realize that there's nothing other than what you're currently experiencing.\n\nIf you slow down and look at the structure of self-image, it's all about what you ***aren't currently experiencing.*** \n\nExample: comparisons, the future, \"me after self-realization\", etc.","timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:14:35.592000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1296417168312897628","message_id":"1296668539440070706","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":68,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1296668271000682620","channel_id":"1296417168312897628","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"IME memories feel nice but it has nothing to do with 2 people","timestamp":"2024-10-18T02:56:46.738000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1296417168312897628","message_id":"1296646516882276405","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":65,"userName":"_diaso_"},{"id":"1296642164327186563","channel_id":"1296417168312897628","author":{"id":"478359517181247490","username":"_diaso_","avatar":"66de051aedb999eec8e4233c11afd878","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Diaso","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"> There are 2 people\n\nThere aren't.\n\n> Is this situation accurate and if so don't self realized people have less positive emotion in this instance? \n\nThe \"situation\" is a comparison.
