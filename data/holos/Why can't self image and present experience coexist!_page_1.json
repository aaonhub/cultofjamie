There is no actual previous because right now is all there ever is, previous moment of present experience is a close way to communicate it but it still fall shorts slightly. Yes the second point is correct \"not necessarily some configuration of physical reality that existed\". We live in a reality where we can only recall, we cannot do anything other than recall, but that recall is a limited interpretation of the experience. It's not cemented and it doesn't exist outside the interpretation. When you experience now in it's entirety you can't recall it because it's one thing and cannot be split up. Recall by definition splits up.","timestamp":"2025-07-05T22:28:20.595000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1380310269409886338","message_id":"1391178569362833539","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":25,"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1391172635219726366","channel_id":"1380310269409886338","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"We currently think of the past as something cemented such as an event that happened.
