So any form of investigation is self inquiry, Negation is one of those forms. The second part - if you want you can. It’s really up to what you desire, there is no “correct” way.","timestamp":"2026-01-31T17:59:02.243000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"276007111337705472","username":"qldisc","avatar":"7661094b263126cc79c9c68cc4799660","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Tik","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1419796763409387710","message_id":"1467106874359808129","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":102,"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1420104648244854947","channel_id":"1419796763409387710","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Just think about yourself for a second, don’t turn away but face what you think you are. Anything that you think of is a thought that contains some version of “yourself” like a human who drives a Toyota and likes to eat mint chocolate ice cream, but this is a thought that contains these attributes or concepts. The point of inspecting your beliefs is just to see them, judgement is not necessary or required in just looking. So just look and it really doesn’t matter what you’re looking at. Thinking is not something to be scared or judgemental about. Thinking is thinking and it’s happening now so there’s nothing to fear about it.\n\nAdvice is on the basis of what you “should” do and there is nothing that you “should” do because there is nothing necessary to get to a destination.
