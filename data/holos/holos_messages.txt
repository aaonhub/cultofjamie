it’s the attachment, the identification to it, and the emotions that come along with it that causes the distraught. Everything you will ever experience is here right now
---MSG---
You only assume a future exists if you believe it does. If your friend says to you he will come then you think that he will come and that’s pretty much it. You go on about your day naturally, maybe thought will come in and be like I need to clean my house and that’s natural. no need to punish yourself for thinking he will come in the “future”, it’s just recognizing the imagination of a future happens now
---MSG---
there is no should in this world, it doesn’t make sense. There is no need either and you’re not doing anything wrong. Do you control thought? If you think you do then who is doing the controlling? the whole point of this is to understand that there is misunderstanding. No need to punish yourself for a thought that arises, it’s simply a thought there is no harm there
---MSG---
is your friend there? If he’s not there then it’s just thought based on the past that he will arrive. What do you mean by a separate future? There is no separation of anything, there can only be separation through thought and imagination
---MSG---
effort only exists in the plane of time, what is effort? effort can only be perceived if there’s continuity. It is a force, when you look at the world it’s just a single frame. There is no force needed for anything in a single frame
---MSG---
just had breakfast any more expansion and my jeans are gonna burst
---MSG---
and with no time there is simply no effort
---MSG---
it happens in a single moment, there is no time necessary. You will actually realize that time is unnecessary
---MSG---
you simply gave yourself relief, anything said has to be filtered through you. There really is no other
---MSG---
why does anxiety exist at all? Why is there a fear of judgement? The only reason for these is because of some imagination of some future that exists. The entirety of future is a concept that you can only imagine, nothing has existed other than right now ever. 10 years in the “future” is just another now. 10 years ago is just another now. 

The reason why people say there is no “me” is because the “me” is created by thought. Thought creates the thinker or the “me”. You don’t have to repeat anything or do anything to be you. It doesn’t make sense to think you could be something other than you. 

Who is this “me”? Is it the body? Is it the mind? What can it be?
---MSG---
plans don’t affect anything they are just another thought and it comes down to desire. You desire something and there’s a fulfillment to the desire. The problems come from when that fulfillment is not reached, but the desire is just desire. We add a bunch of things like expectations and emotions on the desire which creates disappointment when it’s not reached. 

When there is planning there is just recognition of the plan but no stickiness to it. It’s just like getting food, all of the planning is happening right now. There is no future just the plan to acquire what you desire which you can recognize it’s happening now. The “me” thought is just something additional that doesn’t need to be added because that implies ownership where it’s not necessary. You can say it’s natural intelligence or any other label but you don’t need to have a “me” to feel hunger and wanting food to seal that hunger. It’s the same for any other inherent desire
---MSG---
whether you give up or continue it's all the same, only the desire carries
---MSG---
timothee chalamet actually had a quote that went like "You could be the master of your fate. You could be the captain of your soul. But you have to realize that life is coming from you and not at you"

Found zen motorcycles burner lol

anyways, it seems that there is a deep externalization being involved when seeking information for resolution. Every emotion, thought, and feeling ever felt has been experienced internally. Self improvement, self realization, distractions are all what are deemed as externalities. They are actually concepts that are created internally in the mind but the seeking of information outside is what causes confusion. 

Seeking out information is fine with the desire burning, but every single bit of information goes through you. It has to go through you. There are words on the screen, sounds that seem to be coming from the headphones, some object of a screen and content on that screen but that's filtered through you. A sight cannot be seen if your eyes aren't open, a sound cannot be noticed if it's not heard. The whole creation of people like krishnamurti, buddha, jamie whoever it is is all created through thought.

You mention "the same thing over and over" but it's not so true. Because there is no same thing ever. Same thing over and over is a contradiction because there is never a repetition of a moment. The only place the same thing occurs is in thought through a concept and even then it's not the same as it's **always** a new thought.
---MSG---
you can break it down and walk through it yourself. For any decision made the only thing you can project is an imagination of a controller, maybe you imagine your body controlling or your mind controlling. It's something you can walk through

---MSG---
```All of this is to say - to some extent - when you’re really immersed in a particular topic - whether it be art, science, trading, writing, or acting - it’s almost like you stretch yourself out enough that a portal opens *from within you*. And suddenly, things flow out of that portal.

Things you could never have come up with when you were in a normal, mundane everyday state.

Almost the same way that language flows from a chatbot, or how images flow from a dream.

It’s like some sort of base reality is trying to get out - and it needs two initial conditions to do so. 

First having reached a requisite level of engagement to “turn off” your ego. 

Second- a requisite level of expertise to “hold space” for the entire ritual.

Soros couldn’t lose himself in the dance of markets if he wasn’t fully submerged for years in advance, and Hendrix couldn’t lose himself in chords without having first played 5 hour jam sets for months on end.

But once you check the two boxes - something happens. You become a shell, and the universe starts flowing through you. I call this “Having the Mo”.

Momentum. Mojo. Flowing from the Mosaic.```

even what I would say is still created by you for it has to be processed by your mind for “my” words to be understood. There has never been understanding apart from the mind that processes it. But it’s not your mind in that there is a thinker responsible for the thought.
---MSG---
flaws are a concept created currently and pretending is a reference to the concept “flaws” which are also created currently. These are simply concepts applied currently to an entity “me” that you’ve also created through conception. What makes a flaw? What makes one pretend? flaw and pretending to act in comparison to what alternative? If one acts, one acts. The alternatives do not exist at the time of acting, only in reflection do they exist.

the categorization of optimal and suboptimal doesn’t exist apart from the mind’s distinction of it. Does reality or the LLM have to have an optimal nature for existence? What does the distinction of optimal or suboptimal give you?

why would you be or not be a bicycle? You're identifying with something else that's external, whether you are that or not that and that can only be done with the mind. If there's a bicycle there's a bicycle, is there any separation when a sight is seen? Largely through separation of yourself and the object, the mind thinks i'm using this tool, i'm using this hand, i'm using this muscle. But there's **always** the "I" thought that precedes all of that. 

There are eyes that see, but only when referencing the past can that assumption be made. When there is sight there is just sight, not the identification of something being used to see (in this case the eyeballs). When you say "what i see is what i see, so mine is the seeing, not the object being seen" - the object in this case is the body, and it seems there's some identification because it can be seen, felt, and moved around. 

What makes the mind correct? If it seems that the mind is correct there is some duality in play that the mind is incorrect in situations?

The main thing this comes down to is understanding that the separation of one and another is an externalization through the mind. For experience cannot be broken down, separated, or extracted. Identification to one thing or another is a misunderstanding through the identification.
---MSG---
the identification of action is after the fact, but there’s nothing right or wrong with identification of it.  So because there is movement of it does that make it yours to take control of? Is it truly your body? 

If you see something is that sight yours? If you hear something is that sound yours? What makes something yours to possess? 

Action is there, thought is there, sight is there. None of these are different, only in thought can difference be seen. There is nobody doing any of these. The identification of these can only be reflected upon
---MSG---
the identification of action can only occur with identification to a body or mind that is acting
---MSG---
so there is desire then action is taken on that desire. there is a body, how do you know that it’s your body? it can be moved around, physical pain is felt . But then what is different from your body in movement and another body that is seen from another. When identifying with the body there is always the body which is localized and the external world which is projected outwards. if there is a desire to experience cold shower action is taken but is that action yours? Action is there but can only be identified after it’s taken. You take action but that action is not so different than the experience, rather it’s exactly experience. Everything is happening right now, action is not so different
---MSG---
seems there is some identification to the body through movement, mind through decisions and interests. What is experience here. How does one act “on” experience?
---MSG---
you can tell how close they are the more they use “one”

so its *not* a complete shaving of one side of the brain? <:psyduck:873958433316028467>
---MSG---
objectivity doesn’t exist, any external validation or objectivity is still done internally and even that is a concept and division
---MSG---
how do you know it’s correct, any objectivity is some concept thought has created is it not? thought has also created this “every other normal human” concept
---MSG---
the only thing is “other ways” is still your way and deception/temptation is simply a label assigned, neither are good or bad
---MSG---
either Jung or nietzsche or crackhead
---MSG---
sounds like something you’ve conceived, whether someone says something that is still your understanding of it. I say “plump carrot” and you understand it yourself internally
---MSG---
what tendency have you observed
---MSG---
just ask for the removal of the left brain from the doctor
---MSG---
well there’s *not* nothing you can do
---MSG---
in what way can there be an other? Let’s see, there can only be an other if you believe you are something such as connected to a body, mind, soul etc. right now there is an image playing in the mind that the other is separate from you. Is that really true? Is there anybody that has ever existed outside of existence? If you believe they have then they are belief which is still held in thought. There has never been an other, only the one which illuminates. 

Thought has created the thinker, the world, the other, yourself, the chair you’re sitting on. It can only create concepts, words, and separations
---MSG---
these are simply concepts, there is no other presenting them
---MSG---
though anything read and association of it is simply a belief based on the minds comprehension of it. There’s no identification of SR or non-SR required.
---MSG---
it’s like it has to be dug deeply

---MSG---
indeed, it’s a habitual process
---MSG---
being now was the initial cessation of time. colors were more vivid, would only sleep for a few hours a day due to the immense energy, taste was elevated etc. Beyond that there was still some introspection required for emotions because they didn’t seem natural especially things like shame. Then after reading ramana there was a deep enquiry which allowed deeper introspection into “I”, that was the full lobotomy. Emotions arise because of attachment to an identity, majority of emotions use energy and arent necessary
---MSG---
here’s an example

the narrowing is something like a flower that curls upwards out of the ground right before it blooms and expands so gracefully
---MSG---
the click is somewhat similar to the Big Bang in that there’s a narrowing and a complete expansion

there’s a certain distancing of everything but a complete closeness

the watcher is an interesting phenomena, there’s watching but nothing to be watched. Just the watching

and there’s an immense energy felt there
---MSG---
the knack is interesting, it’s a lobotomy every time. It’s easy for thought to pervade, the knack severs
---MSG---
thought creates the thinker
---MSG---
precisely so
---MSG---
stopping thoughts is itself just a conception within thought
---MSG---
thoughts are thoughts, they don’t stop. There’s simply distancing, no entanglement in the thoughts.
---MSG---
found this interesting
---MSG---
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-XA83Morqx/?igsh=MWlnNmpndTZlaW1obw==
---MSG---
you even understand what you don’t understand. You do the filtering and it’s fine, nothing wrong with the filtering but it’s just an added entanglement which is not necessary in the first place
---MSG---
you can look at a subset of information like jk, osho etc and see if the words resonate but every moment is so fresh and new that even a crackhead can resonate. The resonance can come from abstraction like how jk and osho speak but with every fresh moment there’s truly no stickiness to any identity or externalization of another individual.

It doesn’t matter what jk and osho have said or anywhere else, not even the words I write here. Because the entire structure of understanding is your understanding which is practically nobody’s understanding
---MSG---
words are words, dismissing them is giving bias to them at a pre determined rate, it’s under the same spectrum of worshipping words based on identification. The entire concept of the other has been created by the thought, their identity has never existed outside of it
---MSG---
you see text on the screen, you then see who wrote it, then there is some understanding that the person has an identity. It’s just a belief built on another belief. The first one is believing that there is some person that wrote it, the other is that they are “SR” - another identity. One of a person and another of SR
---MSG---
it’s a meaningless metric because any identification of an externalization is a belief
---MSG---
you go to grocery store, you pick food, food safe. you do it again, food safe. Now there is inherent belief/trust that the food is safe when you go to grocery store. You can label it anything you want really, it doesn't matter too much
---MSG---
natural action based on the belief that you're picking up food based on the "past now"
---MSG---
belief in what sense? you see food in a packet at grocery store, there is a belief that that is food when you purchase it since you don't know what's inside. The belief is that there's food and not poison, but it's a belief.
---MSG---
what do you mean beliefs dont happen?

---MSG---
there is no right or wrong way to live, how can there be
---MSG---
there can be misunderstanding, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong it’s just misunderstanding and clearly if you suffer then that misunderstanding will shroud your life and so you desire understanding. Desiring understanding is neither right or wrong either
---MSG---
how is there even any right or wrong, if something is said who cares if it’s right or wrong

---MSG---
not figuring it out = wanting to figure it out = creating some expectation of figuring it out and when the fulfillment isn't experienced there's an imagined suffering
---MSG---
here you say presented to you. but that presentation is really just an understanding that is conceived based on some symbols which you see on the screen. just look now, even with these symbols which are being read, are **never** apart from your understanding of them. They are not some external thing out in an external world.
---MSG---
the presentation is not presented to "you" and there is no separation from the presentation itself by thinking it
---MSG---
that entire presentation is something you've interpreted, has there been any presentation which you haven't interpreted through the mind? presentation is never external
---MSG---
yeah what even is figuring it out, why is there a focus on figuring it out
---MSG---
what a strain name “Bodhi Tree”
---MSG---
it really reminds me a lot of ramana doing the surgery without anesthesia and wincing at the pain. The wincing is a completely natural response, irritability is also quite natural. The ability to observe just takes more energy but when fully rested it takes very little to no energy, quite interesting indeed
---MSG---
<:pepe_sleep_laser:926587897367388202>
---MSG---
yes easy to test by not going to sleep for 3 days, excited to see post investigation analysis
---MSG---
I don’t see irritability as anger
---MSG---
I see irritability as a higher activation energy to observe. When irritable you get absorbed by thought a lot easier. It can look like a lot of different things, irritable to others or even irritable in a tired sense/not desiring to do the work or trying to move away from it when there’s nothing to move away from
---MSG---
from this morning (first time in a while I’ve really been tired) I’d say it’s more of an internal processing like these thoughts come up a lot easier and your ability to just observe them requires a higher activation energy. When tired you just slip into the thoughts a lot quicker, it’s not a battle but more of a surrender to the thought and it just carries everything. But I also feel more irritated that there’s work needed to be done which I don’t desire to do. But then the thought vanishes, it just takes a little longer than when fully rested.
---MSG---
would classify it more as a jumble of thoughts constantly being thrown around
---MSG---
interesting stuff
---MSG---
but when there is activity the paralysis dies down a little but there is still an innate irritability
---MSG---
from the moment of waking up there is just paralysis
---MSG---
so where does the irritability come from
---MSG---
but it’s so interesting with the lack of sleep you want to move away from it but there’s nothing to move away from
---MSG---
yeah the combination of lack of sleep and caffeine is really a double punch
---MSG---
feeling it today immensely, for some reason remembered this message you sent a while ago
---MSG---
yeah feel this a lot
---MSG---
what use is it to replicate something dead
---MSG---
yes and the chase begins to replicate it
---MSG---
it’s stepping back rather than rushing to resolve any problem you’ve ever had
---MSG---
I’ve seen some people using a stepping back, I like this quite a lot
---MSG---
you’ve created a goal just as you’ve approached any problem in the past. The goal is to end suffering, but ending suffering is never a goal. Goals require some imagination of a “future”, one you can plan out and map. You’re attempting to use your previous mechanical problem solving to solve a problem that has never existed
---MSG---
and this chase gives them a goal
---MSG---
one can be addicted to the chase rather than anything permanently ending it
---MSG---
you’ve created it **all**
---MSG---
you are trying to think of a solution when you have created the imaginary problem and you want the imaginary solution.
---MSG---
the desire to know is there but you are not seeking the desire you are seeking the fulfillment of the desire. Ones entire life has been dictated by fulfillment and once they are fulfilled they move on. But moreso there’s expectation and when the expectation of fulfillment is not complete there is frustration
---MSG---
it’s so interesting these questions I can feel the complication in them, there’s a sensation of going down into some territory in my brain to unravel it.
---MSG---
existence is not seeing and hearing for that implies someone doing that act. The fundamental question is has sight existed **ever** apart from you? Has the sound **ever** existed apart from you? You can think they existed but that’s a thought not the actual sound or sight. I can ask you who’s hearing or who’s seeing, but that will loop you as I’m sure you’ve been asked it countlessly. 

Why does one need to establish a difference in the first place. Sound is sound, sight is sight. What satisfaction are you seeking from differentiating it all
---MSG---
what makes it different
---MSG---
is it really different?
---MSG---
what do you mean by this
---MSG---
you will if the desire is there
---MSG---
nice would love an update in a week/month to see if it still holds true, had a similar experience on shrooms but nothing stuck

yeah maybe give it a few days/weeks
---MSG---
it's only simple when it's untangled, in the entanglement it's wildly complex
---MSG---
goals can be projected, goals can be checked off. the projection and checking off both happen at the same discontinuous moment
---MSG---
what they are doing is absolute perfection, even the misunderstanding is perfect
---MSG---
don't really see it as a problem, it's just a misunderstanding/misconception
---MSG---
and every self improver has a goal, when the goal is always imagined

yeah, maybe there were a lot of engineers/programmers that weren’t effective. But also they didn’t get fired en masse before the high interest rates, companies could keep them on balance sheet and companies exponentially grew workforce post 2010-2021/2022. Replacing jobs is tricky, we don’t know currently which jobs will be replaced. You’re right though that AI is quite fuzzy and it needs to be fine tuned/evolve before it becomes standardized.

I’m building an application on top of LLM, I don’t know if it will replace anything as that isn’t my focus but it’s fun exploring and seeing what’s currently possible. I’m not sure what will happen down the line
---MSG---
in the 80s computers were almost exclusively used by programmers. Applications evolve, and so will this one. It’s not so much as what’s currently there as much as what sticks and the possibilities there. 

There are a bunch of reasons programmers were fired, but companies cutting costs is perfectly normal with high interest rates especially those businesses that rely on loans
---MSG---
I know a bunch of programmers that love it

it only hurts when you perceive someone is being hurt or damaged, look at the recording what was there at the recording, was there anyone really there?
---MSG---
you see a tree, and the tree is floating in air. That tree at first sight is just sight, there is no judgement. judgement comes when reflecting on the recording. what about the recording sucks? it's simply recording
---MSG---
if there's no label of it, then what sucks about it? if it's a feeling, the feeling always is derived of something not now and is held in reference to the input of the recording
---MSG---
all you've done is put a label on the recording of the 5 senses and slapped suffering on top of it
---MSG---
that terrible rejection you faced, that's created right now
---MSG---
that suffering you were talking about, that's created right now
---MSG---
you are always creating the thought now
---MSG---
the thought is registration now of a recording that is now
---MSG---
when it's immediately read it's sight, so when does it become thought
---MSG---
indeed and when does that thought arise
---MSG---
but where do the thoughts come from? what is the origin story
---MSG---
JK -> JL
---MSG---
just look
---MSG---
don't move away
---MSG---
don't judge
---MSG---
just look
---MSG---
some people think it's focus on a certain area or focus somewhere
---MSG---
attention != focus in this interpretation from what i can see of it, whether you focus or not it's really all there is right now so it never mattered at all what you are doing
---MSG---
if you don't desire you will leave or you will not type/read
---MSG---
why other than the desire to be on the discord? is there any other reasoning required? but you can only reflect on this desire looking back as in it's another thought you are thinking now
---MSG---
there is never anything wrong with desire nor right with desire. desire is just desire
---MSG---
you are hungry so you desire to eat
---MSG---
your arm is in completely damaged with your wrist out of alignment, you desire for it to feel better. That's completely natural.
---MSG---
the desire is the crux of existence
---MSG---
one doesn't need to stop desiring
---MSG---
any time you're thinking of fruits of anything at all, you've become attached to some goal and moreso the expectation of fulfilling that goal in some imagined place other than now
---MSG---
```Thy right is to work only, but never to its fruits; let the fruit of action be not thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction``` - krishna
---MSG---
saying it's just a thought does not mean to belittle the thought or say it's just something, thoughts are thoughts. sight is sight
---MSG---
by going away from suffering, you've created some goal of moving away. so there is a desire and there is a fulfillment of that desire. right now you are desiring to move away but the desire does not exist without the fulfillment of moving away. What if that desire never gets fulfilled? Suffering does not come from some past image it comes from wanting to move away from what's on the screen but moreso the expectation of fulfilling that desire to permanently move away. You will see that the more you want to move away, the more you are creating this eternal suffering because these thoughts live in a complete cyclical permanence. New thoughts will always come in, and every time a new thought comes in relating to you suffering, you punish yourself when it's just a thought.
---MSG---
information comes in through the senses, why does one need to follow anything at all
---MSG---
whatever jk wants you to do is just yourself wanting to do what an image of jk wants you to do. You've created jk, you're interpreting jk, and you now want to follow jk
---MSG---

what is attention in your interpretation, for you have created attention, the association of attention, the identification of some definition of attention. Do you not see how everything external you've created internally?

looking **is** the experience

---MSG---
it's all looking
---MSG---
it's similar to being a child, you don't want to hurt anyone. But that harm is itself an image being created now of just an interpretation. example was that at the restaurant had an experience of the waitress looking dissapointed i didn't enjoy the food because i was eating slow. She had a painful look in her eyes and appeared as mad as she picked up my plate and just dropped it. So it took some time (maybe a couple days) to untangle that experience
---MSG---
confusion is such a blissful experience, not knowing and wanting to know
---MSG---
you look at them, look at the tree, the entire structure
---MSG---
but it was just looking at something fresh not currently happening to any central entity, but the brain has some stickiness to previous concepts and identities that are inert
---MSG---
there have been a couple times of confusion interfacing shame and expectations of fulfillment that needed to be untangled after the whole narrowing and widening

your concept of an apple is creating an object externally in the world. And then once you’ve recognized what an apple is from seeing, smelling, tasting etc you now can link it to memory or association of the apple. But it’s always going to require the sensory perceptions now to be aware of it and then identify it. The separation occurs due to this externalization of the world and yourself, you believe you’re the subject and the apple is the object. You don’t need another object to separate an apple because you’re already externalizing it from yourself.

Correct you can only think of truth, truth always lives in the dimensionality of true and false. Thus truth always lives in distinction. 

Harms you? Who is it harming? Is it the body that’s being harmed, the mind, the senses?

so your definition of a “real thing” is one that is actually happening? But how do you know that thing is happening? You don’t have to think of something happening now for it to happen right? Only when you think can you reflect that thing happened at some time other than now.

How are real things conceptual things happening now in altered forms? Embodiment is also something conceptual no? How can you identify embodiment or reality?
---MSG---
i'm still confused what you mean by real/fake, you say concepts are fake since they're in your head and you could never sense them outside of thought but the instantiation is real. But this doesn't make sense, concepts aren't real/fake they're just a limitation as they are distinctions separating one thing and another. And you've never thought something outside of your thoughts right now. Even things that you think are not there, are **still** encased within thought that you are thinking it's not there. Also you say the instatiation is real, but how is the instantiation real, the instantiation is just another thought. You've created some projection of the future with this instantiation and because the prediction was "correct" about the weather you've thought that was real, but that is all held in thought. It doesn't make it any more real just because there was a prediction about it

An apple is a concept because there was extraction of the apple from vision, smell, taste etc and you've extrapolated something conceptual from that and then associated something like a word. But then you also say the real is "entirely composed of embodied representations of concepts" which doesn't make sense because that sounds the same thing as fake in the definition you've given earlier.
---MSG---
but that future is not anything real. It's a pointer to some image which is not the real thing
---MSG---
and what is fake then?
---MSG---
what real things are you referring to?

you can easily slip into non duality just from non thought! Thought is always going to be dual or distinct
---MSG---
are you any different from the sensory perception there? There’s sight, who is seeing? Look at some rice you ate, was there truly anyone eating or was there just taste, touch, smell, sight, sound when first interfacing with the rice. There’s JUST interfacing via senses, there’s NO central entity controlling or using the senses
---MSG---
animals are another great reference point of non duality

A cat never knows it’s a cat, it acts and it reacts. It never knows it does “cat things” or acts a certain way. That’s a close representation of non duality. It’s not a magic
---MSG---
I never really resonated with the “part of” because that assumes you are incomplete. And you are never incomplete. There is nothing missing, there is nothing separate. There is pure completion and even thinking that thought is pure completion. Just see for yourself that the composition of existence is pure awareness, whether thinking, seeing, hearing. Beliefs through thought, trees through seeing are  illusory because they are identifications, but the sensory perception and the awareness of that is **never** incomplete
---MSG---
the thought is an isolation, but the thinking is totality because you’re experiencing it now, and the totality is simply the awareness of that now for you are simply the awareness of the sensory perception. It’s not like there is experience apart from your current experience, that is simply thought coming in and separating it. You ARE sight and that’s the experience as awareness shines the light. There is no central entity seeing. It is simply seeing a sight in a complete loop. You ARE suffering, there is no separation. You are not identifying something external and clinging onto it, but you are that because there is no separation
---MSG---
but yes it’s a pointer to now
---MSG---
even thinking the thought is part of something is still a thought

And the desire carried him to keep communicating, but there's no way of knowing whether the words actually resonated with people even if he believed they did, there's no way to know.

the word is not the thing, you can freely share and communicate. But the understanding comes down to that every word is limited, even if you say something it's always going to live in distinction.

you can see for yourself, that anything outside of your immediate perception is a belief. Anything that requires memory to project if something exists now outside of the immediate perception is a belief. If your parent is not in front of you how do you know they exist?

the availability is a belief, you can only think of the thought that’s there. Even thinking there is availability of other thoughts is itself a thought

---MSG---
you can call it the past, but that’s another label put on top. You can call it previous now but that’s just another label on top. You are thinking of these labels now, you are thinking of the memory (which you label has occurred in the past) now, you have always lived now, there has never been anything continuous in your entire life, it’s all been one now
---MSG---
the contents of the memory are not now, but you’re thinking of them now and they are new thoughts that you are thinking. 

When there is experience via our eyes, taste, touch there is a recording. This recording we can say it’s not now because it’s only in our thoughts looking back via the registration of thought. “At that time” was also the now, but now looking back at the recording with the lens of  thought it is not now.
---MSG---
everything you’ve experienced is now, so the senses at that time of recording that created that initial contact is now, with thought coming in after is now, reflecting back on that string of memory is now
---MSG---
what do you mean by “me at a past time”
---MSG---
“I never existed in the past” - there’s three assumptions here. “I”, “exists”, “past”. So when we go back to looking at the ice cream eaten yesterday, that is an isolated event because memory can only record isolations. The lens used to perceive the ice cream is sight, sound, smell, taste, touch. The 5 senses are all that’s there in initial contact. The moment you record that ice cream whether identifying it’s ice cream, or eating a bite and registering it, is when thought comes in and at that point that ice cream and that initial contact point becomes memory. There was nobody there involved in eating that ice cream, there was just contact with the ice cream using the senses. The memory is not by anyone but memory is just memory just like the tree is just the tree that eyes are used to see.
---MSG---
sure and what was the lens used to create that data that is stored?
---MSG---
that memory that you recall now
---MSG---
let’s keep it on the memory
---MSG---
and in what way was that event experienced?
---MSG---
when looking back at the “past” what do you think of? What do you see? Let’s start with a simple example of yesterday

“Im a loser” or identifying as anything at all and getting entangled with that is not necessary. Who is the loser? What is a loser? There was experience and the registration of that experience is through thought that you are thinking now, but at the point of experience there was just the sensory perception, so this judgement on top of the experience is not necessary in the first place. It’s really a stepping back and looking at the “thought tree” rather than getting entangled within it

---MSG---
of course if the pain was unbearable then I would go to a doctor, but it’s not needed in the current state. If the desire was strong enough I’d be in the hospital but am currently ok to move around and even squat gently
---MSG---
even saying you are pain is not meant to consolidate that pain to an object and associating but moreso that there’s no separation of it
---MSG---
pain is so interesting because there’s such an intense desire to move away from it. Pain is entirely mental because there are pockets where if awareness just dissolves away then there is no pain experienced at all. Unless it’s completely overwhelming but even that is still entirely held in thought. Had an experience where I was squatting and I heard a large crunch in my lower back with a very very intense sharp pain. I started walking around and it got a little better and I just maneuvered the gym gently. Afterwards there was still a radiating pain which Im currently feeling but you can just observe this instead of constantly moving away. You are pain, pain is not separate. No need to move away or towards it. Most of the pain is actually the identification tied with the future and future scenarios. If there is no moving away you’re just left with all there is
---MSG---
but the past’s contents isn’t now, it’s mostly to say that those thoughts are experienced now but they’re composed of not now so then why is there worry at all
---MSG---
almost everything said was a concept in which you’ve interpreted as some objectivity. Even measurement, which is what you use to validate that objectivity, is itself a concept in which you’ve thought. Can you use a concept to validate a concept? Why is it necessary to create the concept in the first place
---MSG---
Are you fully happy and at peace with this?
---MSG---
degrees of correctness of which the process is greater?
---MSG---
even the querying of the many individuals goes through thought and thus even those individuals are created by thought. If they say something, they are just emitting sounds, the understanding is all transmuted through your thought!
---MSG---
thought has created this objectivity, objectivity does not exist
---MSG---
ah is this the neekeetah methodology?
---MSG---
reminded me of this:

https://youtu.be/Ekp_NNtSho0?si=ZzInLGGGTLsrP-DV
---MSG---
so any description of anyone is thought creation, is there any need to resist thoughts at all? Anything can be there, fire can extinguish the environment, why would there be any resistance to it, sight does not resist so why does thought resist for isn’t thought perception as well?
---MSG---
where is all this description created? Is this something external or is the creation itself within you?
---MSG---
why is there resistance, they are just words and symbols. But if there’s no resonance there’s no need to force either
---MSG---
here’s the last resource that I remember really resonates deeply

---MSG---
there could be some identification with intelligence, idealized now, awareness as some entity and that needs to be investigated thoroughly as well
---MSG---
the desire carries, if the desire is there to speak and communicate and if it’s a strong enough desire the communication will come through. 

communication is always going to be limited, but it allows to point to what is not. when there are messages of utilizing “I” or “me” it’s simply for communication, and the question will always revert to “who is this I or me”

When looking back at the ramen yesterday, there was only taste sight, smell, touch, and hearing. But this associated “I” needs to be investigated

Will be joining Julien this weekend at Otakon, though would love to chat some other time
---MSG---
you can remember of the ramen became thought allows you to recall memory, it’s just a localized isolation of it. There is no sight within memory but memory allows you a pointer to the experience
---MSG---
but at that time of the ramen being seen or eaten, who or what was eating it? Was there anyone? If there wasn’t anyone eating it, was the tool of sight, taste used by someone?
---MSG---
but how is that pizza experience if it’s from yesterday, who even is eating it/how was it experienced

one thing i really liked was Hannah’s pizza example

is there anyone or anything using the tool?

for example emotions like shame can arise but are they interfaced in the same way? That is the experience that will be interfaced with

---MSG---
seek/desire implies you are separate from that which is being seeked/desired and thus you have externally created some object to seek
---MSG---
seek implies time. “Don’t seek” means that “someone” is created to seek something that isn’t there but the object of desire which is being seeked will eventually be there. Haven’t seen the video so have to hear it
---MSG---
there is no someone coughing, that is you coughing <a:aPES_Cough:693519540721680446>
---MSG---
or is desire constantly attached to the fulfillment and expectation is placed on top. If so why is there any expectation at all?
---MSG---
Can desire exist without **any** expectation of fulfillment
---MSG---
Will give it a watch later thanks
---MSG---
the entire existence is dictated by desire but that can only be labeled after
---MSG---
that’s just another label
---MSG---
desire is never good or bad
---MSG---
me putting words there doesn’t suffice as anything
---MSG---
simply observe it all
---MSG---
observe it when you eat something delicious or have sex or any of this, observe the desire, then the experience, then the fulfillment of the desire once it’s fulfilled
---MSG---
how can one desire at all for any desire assumes some identification
---MSG---
the desire itself is illusory
---MSG---
the desire is taking the past and imaginging the future on this past and seeking that desire to achieve some fulfillment
---MSG---
for what's there cannot be desired for the desire is only some reflection of thought from the past, how is desire different than just the thought
---MSG---
but is that desires contents composed of what's there now
---MSG---
you can see when a desire arises it arises from this unconscious plane
---MSG---
for anything
---MSG---
the brain has evolved (which is a belief) but we can't even say our memory from this body creates this inherent desire
---MSG---
but that latent desire, is that even the current body expressing that desire
---MSG---
separation can only occur in thought of conscious and unconscious
---MSG---
or both
---MSG---
is the desire something of unconscious or conscious layer
---MSG---
can you desire something which you don't know of
---MSG---
are all concepts just beliefs
---MSG---
that's all you can do if you infer any form of change
---MSG---
but rather the same
---MSG---
birth to now not being a progression

this discord has so much information from many many months and the same questions are always asked again and again including this one. Why is it that the acquisition of more information cannot resolve any of it ever? it's never more understanding

It doesn’t matter what he says or doesn’t say, telling someone to not do something is the same thing that the religions do which you crucify

whose thoughts are they? who is remembering? who disrespected who? who or what is the person being disrespected
---MSG---
really brilliant
---MSG---
there is seeing but nothing seen, there is hearing but nothing heard. For if there is something there is a distinction of that thing being seen and that thing being heard from a creation of someone seeing and hearing. The objects can only be identified after the experience is taken hold. All of it is now, so there is after but there is truly no after.

---MSG---
the reality “around you” is just an externalization. Reality is not located anywhere
---MSG---
indeed, interacting with “something else” is just you interacting with thought configured in an external direction. if there is no externalization there is nothing other than you for you are all there is
---MSG---
what is everything else?
---MSG---
as soon as we classify the “other person” that’s a separation that occurs with thought, is there anything apart from you?
---MSG---
you can call it this immunity or moreso an indifference/pure acceptance of anything that’s there
---MSG---
but the distancing even when they are angry is still there. Even the identification of them being angry is a concept created by thought
---MSG---
always this immediate presence that that is the past, no idea how to really say it other than the focus readjusts to what’s going on now
---MSG---
just an interesting observation all around where before I would feel very bad and want to please the other person, but that other person is just you there is no separation
---MSG---
there’s nothing there that can harm for that is just a thought and the one being harmed is another thought as well
---MSG---
so interesting when someone is mad/upset with you because it’s immediately recognized that the person is just mad at an image and there’s always this distance (even this entire conception is all a thought). Nothing involved other than just observing it and even then there is a distance of effect. There is some semblance you don’t want to let them down but even that doesn’t have any strangle really

---MSG---
“importance” signifies meaning, and there truly is no meaning to any of it. It’s like saying life has a meaning when life is a concept and so is importance/meaning all in thought. you can only categorize something as important if there’s something unimportant. Attention doesn’t have any sense of importance for that is just another thought
---MSG---
paying attention to something doesn’t imply importance. You can pay attention to a tree but that doesn’t imply importance to the tree, the importance is just another thought given on top of the attention. When a thought arises it just arises, when a sight is seen it’s just seen
---MSG---
the "reflection of something else" is itself a thought
---MSG---
I liked Julien’s explanation here as well
---MSG---
it’s really interesting because when we see something, many times we just see it, we don’t associate the seer with the seeing in that moment because it’s just a sight being seen. But for some reason we always go to the thinker when thinking and trying to uncover the identity, I’ve observed this phenomenon. 

Maybe there are people when seeing something they think there’s a “seer” but then again that’s an identification that they are the body and the world is external.

You **are** seeing, but who is the you that’s seeing. You **are** thinking but who is the you that’s thinking.

The seeing of the sight is one loop, the thinking of the thought is one loop. There is no separation and only identification of an individual doing the loop creates the separation.
---MSG---
if one desires, they will ask questions, fall flat, try again. It's truly the desire that carries. The desires have been deemed external for many, and this distinction has caused them to constantly seek outside
---MSG---
yes these are all natural and nothing is right or wrong with anything. only the identification to what's right or wrong causes this constant internal suffering (in which the suffering is also natural and isn't right or wrong)
---MSG---
problems are created and they vanish when there is a belief that a solution resolves the problem
---MSG---
and for some reason we believe that moving away is the solution, when there is truly no problem or harm in the first place
---MSG---
you can call it anything you want really, assuming the problem creates harm is itself the loop. Moreso when the thought is there it's just there, but then there's more thought that comes in and there's identification with that thought that creates the harm. If there's a problem that's just a label given and when there's a solution that's another label given. the harm aspect is an identification, which we are thinking now, that is conjured based on the reference that there even is a solution to the problem. "I am being harmed and i want to move away" - we label the thought as a problem first, then we say we are being harmed second, then we want to move away from that harm third.
---MSG---
yes even the act of trying to solve the problem assumes there's problem to be solved in the first place! The thought creates the problem and it creates the solution and the whole structure
---MSG---
and vice versa
---MSG---
there are no solutions if there are no problems
---MSG---
even if one doesn't experience peace or love that is also happening now so it's truly nothing to fight for or against, unless if they desire to

if only words could capture it, peace/love is all there truly is and it's always felt

---MSG---
well the experiencer is created by the experience
---MSG---
"less me" or "more me" can only be understood in thought, for the "now" is only created by the sensory perceptions that you are perceiving. You are seeing now and that's it and that's all it can ever be, you are hearing now and that's it that's all it can ever be. the "me" being created cannot be more or less based on the subtraction of one or multiple senses. there is no addition or subtraction to it. 

Like when you think of a memory, you are thinking to some information. That information was only retrieved by the sensory perception at that "now", so you are whatever sensory perception that is occuring because that's the only thing that's happening right now
---MSG---
it's just that you are seeing and there is no sight without seeing, any sight is what you are since you "illuminate" it. Your perception of seeing that sight is all one, it's not a distinct "seer" and "sight". The "seer" is something you've created from thought. It's like a loop basically that's all just one thing.
---MSG---
when the object is what you create in the first place all within thought, so when you subtract away the objects what is there
---MSG---
sort of like you create this object "perception" and then you say that you are that object (it was like this when i first listened to jk about this topic)
---MSG---
because in a way it's easy to slip into "you are something" which you are not that *thing*, but you just are
---MSG---
i found this very abstract when i first encountered it, especially with the "you are sight, you are sound, you are thought"

yep thought creates the thinker/observer

when thinking of any emotion such as anger, jealousy, anything at all you're truly creating that anger and thus you are that anger that you create. the creation itself is created by you

i've been noticing something very interesting, when you laugh at something it's truly you laughing at yourself. For the mind creates the memory and you're just laughing at that memory so it's just laughing at yourself since thought creates it all, the references, the joke etc
---MSG---
yep the relationship is truly them and themself, sound is not external to us, sight is not external to us. The relationship assumes there’s something external when there truly isn’t, that’s only the mind creating the external vs internal
---MSG---

---MSG---
i like this explanation:

``` This very transaction between them forms the basis of what they understand reality to be. From this perspective, the tree that falls in the forest with no one else to hear it doesn’t make a sound (though it may have other effects), because the sound exists only in this transaction itself, just like the embedded word only exists in the relationship with other words. And also like that embedded word, the person hearing the sound of the tree is not hearing an objective phenomenon, but a relationship between themself and the tree. ```
---MSG---
it seems there's two lines of thinking. One line is "I am hurt due to memories" and another is "i know this conceptually to be wrong". The second thought is basically going against the first thought and there's conflict there, one thought with another. But when you're thinking a thought now, there's just a "new thought". It's always a "new thought" never the old thought that you believed was there. The "new thought" references the old thought but it itself is never the old thought. 

So when you say "i know this conceptually to be wrong" - what makes the memory wrong and this concept right? Why does one thought attack the other. Both of these are created by thought and the concept attacking the other thought is itself created by thought. Can you see for yourself the loop that exists perpetually?
---MSG---
indeed the thought creates the thinker
---MSG---
and then applying it to itself
---MSG---
so this struggle is thought creating the concept of struggle
---MSG---
the “mind” as a separate entity is still created by the mind

now my experience day to day feels like a void/much more thoughtless when I sit there. A lot of it is sort of just a jumbled singularity and it’s strange when I scroll social media because before I would have emotional reactions and that would sort of carry over to other parts including ambition, getting triggered by parents etc. now theres absolutely none of that. It's really an indifference to what's there because you are always creating and just are what's there!

not offensive at all, it’s interesting to look back at it (even though it’s limited since it’s all memory)

it was over the course of 4 years, I did a lot of stuff in between like personality stuff like enneagram, socionics, MBTI etc because it was interesting but at some point it was too much. I really liked Steve Jobs and wanted to emulate him, so when I took a personality test I would just make my persona to match his and try to “become” him if that makes sense. It was probably a culmination of curiosity and obsession
---MSG---
No one is getting SR anymore, what a shame
---MSG---
it started in 2020, lots of things happening including *you know what* and a few other things so I had a total reset basically. My mind was like a baby receptive to all sorts of information. So I adopted a largely plant based diet based on the videos I saw online, watched a bunch of people like krishnamurti, mooji, papaji, ramana, kapil Gupta. But then after a month or two of it just reverted to my work/original state. But at that point still kept eating vegetarian/went vegan shortly after. Really interesting how the plant based diet stuck and the “SR” stuff didn’t if you can call it that. 

But then Jamie uploaded a video in 2023 and I was surprised but didn’t really look too deep into it, just watched one of his videos.

Then in 2024 not too long ago I read the Gita and wasn’t satisfied. Really was confused by the fruits and the labor and how can someone do something without thinking of the fruit of it. Why did Arjuna even have the duty, why does it matter if he carried it out.

Then I went back to a couple things like Tao Te Ching and still didn’t get it, watched a bunch of krishnamurti videos and still was confused. Then somehow the stuff that Krishnamurti said seeped into the brain and my mind became lucid/drunk and my head started pulsating specifically the back of my skull.
It’s just a belief, but I think this allowed my mind some space as the center of thought processing was confused.

Then went back to Jamie’s video, still a little confused but added a lot more clarity. hopped in this discord and shortly after read something profound that caused the wave of realization to flood.

if Alan watts hits deep so be it, if crackhead hits deep so be it, if JK hits deep so be it, if cult leader hits deep so be it. you’ll see for yourself the neurosis/quality of communication when observing them if it exists
---MSG---
but purposely disregarding it/placing into buckets is truly another identification that needs to be investigated
---MSG---
what dictates utility? Usefulness is just more thought is it not? One thing about JK, Ramana, Jamie is that you can truly resonate with the content because it’s something abstract and something you have to figure out on your own. A crackhead/cult leader typically will automatically create inconsistency so the information is not going to have the same quality, but that you understand within your own thought

@pikachu_is_boss I’ll just reply here, so when there’s identification of SR vs non SR theres a restriction of the information being entered. This is talking strictly of identification, not the information being said. People can say anything and if that causes you to realize then so be it but identifying first if someone is SR and then basing the knowledge given after that seems neurotic/too attached to the identification of SR. 

I’m sure you have your own intuition of who’s SR and that’s innate within what they say. Alan Watts was someone who proclaimed to not “be SR” but if the information resonates it does, same with a crackhead giving you information. 

The main thing is you can identify SR vs non SR but the barrier placed is another limitation and thus it’s not necessary when intaking the communication.
---MSG---
tierless tier system
---MSG---
is there a tier with no tiers
---MSG---
really anyone who claims they are SR aren't actually for the description is just a symbol, a distinction. It's an entire loop, only you can believe if someone is SR within your thought as it's a distinction to categorize. It’s just another identity, who and what is SR to you
---MSG---
thought creates the thinker

```
Thought is verbalized sensation; thought is the response of memory, the word, the experience, the image. Thought is transient, changing, impermanent, and it is seeking permanency. So thought creates the thinker, who then becomes the permanent; he assumes the role of the censor, the guide, the controller, the molder of thought. This illusory permanent entity is the product of thought, of the transient. This entity is thought; without thought he is not. The thinker is made up of qualities; his qualities cannot be separated from himself. The controller is the controlled, he is merely playing a deceptive game with himself. Till the false is seen as the false, truth is not.```
---MSG---
it really makes me wonder if we think at all when we are first born, whether our brain starts instantly recording or not. We don't recall the memories of experience as a baby so it's all interesting, but there maybe some that do. In my experience I'm not able to really recall anything at birth

yeah the senses really come "alive" when the neurotic emotions aren't there i noticed that as well
---MSG---
yes i can only describe it as wanting to change what's there instead of purely accepting it
---MSG---
really interesting experience
---MSG---
and it was pulsating
---MSG---
i had a similar experience where i had to ice the back of my skull
---MSG---
was it pulsating?
---MSG---
these are all really one, they’re all apart of the same thing. It’s all one experience, it’s all there is and all there has ever been
---MSG---
the world being external to you, happiness being external to you, the person on the street being external to you, the body being external to you, any form of externality. For the identification happens when we believe there is a distinction, separation of one thing and another
---MSG---
you truly can only find out when it’s not known, “I don’t know” - cherish this, see who does not know, who’s creating these externalities
---MSG---
when in pain the body uses the senses to escape the pain and it's quite a useful thing as the body seeks to survive. This is why emotions are created such as fear to escape from the tiger or bear in the wild. But we've crossed over utilizing those emotions into things that aren't actually there
---MSG---
so if you're depressed because some identification to a previous image, you can truly observe it and you can see that it's all thought. Observe that thought, observe the identification and separation of yourself and the externality that you've created
---MSG---
you know what happiness/clarity is like because it's truly a natural state if one can say that. When we are in a state of emotion apart from that happiness or clarity we desire strongly to go back to that happiness/clarity because that is what's natural/what the mind finds most peaceful. When we are happy we don't desire to suffer, unless one gains pleasure in suffering. We seek pleasure because we believe that external pleasure can create this happiness, when happiness is not something external to us. 

When we are depressed we seek to not be depressed, but that causes an infinite loop of wanting the screen to change instead of just observing what the depression itself is. When the body is hungry it eats and then moves on, unlike this suffering when we do the "external" activity we are still in a suffering state and we strongly desire to be at peace.
---MSG---
you can desire to get out of the pain there's nothing right or wrong with that
---MSG---
you are hungry so you seek food because the body needs food to survive, you can only define the utility of getting that food or eating that food within thought. Whether you eat or don't eat doesn't really mean anything. There is no right or wrong in wanting food because it's all apart of the experience. What you eat, where you eat doesn't mean anything because it's all happening now
---MSG---
thinking what we do is useful or useless is again a distinction
---MSG---
thought creates usefulness, utility etc
---MSG---
utility is only something we define within thought, is there any utility apart from thought?
---MSG---
this desire that what's there is not enough
---MSG---
the seeking arises from wanting the screen to change
---MSG---
the analyzing keeps perpetuating the thinking and it never ends
---MSG---
seeking is believing there is a goal
---MSG---
correct, seeking is believing you don't have which you are seeking
---MSG---
i like this "Now is always new"
---MSG---
if there is no solution, then there is no problem
---MSG---
you've just created this new thought now. If we've seen this for what it is then it's just thought has convinced itself that the thought needing convincing is real. Really it's thought attacking itself. The identification of what's real and whats not. The identification of what's a problem and what's a solution. If the mind never creates the problem the mind doesn't need a solution.
---MSG---
you can notice this all for yourself, i'm sure you've felt unsatisfied, but why do you want the screen to change so badly? What is there that lacks within you? Is it something external? If it's something external please observe/identify it, see what it truly is
---MSG---
in this case it's not being satisfied with what's on the scren (your current situation, your current understanding, your current abilities) and wanting the screen to change. It's really the desire, the pain-staking desire for the screen to change that's causing your suffering. And it's the very strict desire of wanting JK to change all that, maybe even ignoring your current "now" in desire of specifically wanting JK. Though this is a very grainy observation just from what you've said
---MSG---
maybe there is some fear that if you don't get it from JK you're not able to get it at all?
---MSG---
i like this
---MSG---
war is a result of emotion, emotion is many a times a result of identification in some way, and the identification causes the constant cyclical nature of thought to constantly continue.
---MSG---
from my understand he says this to exemplify the limitation of thought and the result that the limitation creates
---MSG---
there's more to understand from your emotions/thoughts than anything else. For everything is one and there is no internal/external at all or else there's some intrinsic separation there. If there is separation then there's identification to something whether it's to your body or mind. Speakers are really interesting because the pointers they share really let you simmer with those distinctions deeply of which I didn't previously think about before hearing them. You can go through an entire list of speakers and either not get close or get it or you can listen to 1 speaker and get it immediately. If the desire is there you will do it

One thing with the various speakers is truly sink in with what they're saying at the moment, if you let your past dictate what you should do/not do then the message will not be given the attention needed. You can get a message from a crackhead on the streets and if it resonates then it resonates.
---MSG---
haven't really dove deep into alan watts. fear is an interesting emotion when thinking about why you like him. Is it fear that you're not doing things the right way? Or fear that you're attached at his ideas and the stickiness to what he says?
---MSG---
but really if you don't understand one speaker or their perspective, the desire will just continue. There's nothing right or wrong with wanting different viewpoints
---MSG---
you can try 100 different speakers if there is desire for more information. There's really different resonating features with different speakers even though they approach a lot to the same. You can read/listen to Ramana as well and I enjoyed this translation: https://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1131306781281353869/1258914712297410720
---MSG---

---MSG---
yes you can read that version of tao te ching and see if it resonates with you. But good/bad can only be decided within your thought
---MSG---
only you within your thoughts can decide what's good and bad since it's a distinction made from your thought
---MSG---
at some point there will be this realization that it doesn’t matter what’s on the screen!
---MSG---
thinking the hologram is symbolizing itself is like saying the thoughts on the screen (the object that we’ve identified) is symbolizing the individual when in reality that is just a thought, for the symbol can never capture what it is describing completely and there is no individual at all! The “individual” it is capturing is not separate from the rest and the separation of each entity is something that can only be present through distinction (thought). It can only use a symbol to point to, and the pointing is never that which is pointed
---MSG---
the tv can display an image of a picture of the tv that someone took, but that is not what the tv actually is. For the tv is not encapsulated within an image. The hologram is just the hologram, the identification of the hologram being something else or representing something else is just a thought that we think. 

Are you the image on the screen? Is the hologram what it’s pointing to or is it just the hologram
---MSG---
it’s really transcendental when the realization is made that the self never sleeps for there is memory recalled even from sleep. When waking up you can remember the thoughts from sleeping. Yet, in sleep the world doesn’t exist as it does when you’re awake. Who thinks of the dream during sleep if not the self
---MSG---
and I’m talking of the reference right now, right now all you can do is think to that “there” wherever that is via reference **right now this moment**
---MSG---
the reference is all you have from when you were there, is it not? And that reference is just a description that you can use to recall no?
---MSG---
can you truly recreate the experience? What is this experience you’re re-creating? When you think of a thought it’s just that, a piece of the totality, a reference to a previous thought. An incomplete shard, is this even necessary whatsoever if it is just a reference? If it’s something thats just a reference why do we have any emotion whatsoever from these thoughts?
---MSG---
and what goal is that? It seems you’ve utilized thought your entire life but this goal has never gotten closer, rather there’s this inherent nature the more you’ve attempted at the goal it’s just gotten further
---MSG---
why do you say that? What point does usefulness have to you?
---MSG---
whether you accept or deny the words makes no difference. There is never any difference here now, any image you have of another/yourself is one that you’ve created
---MSG---
there is no offense really
---MSG---
why agree at all? What makes you agree? when you say useful this is just a description you’ve given it maybe based on some idealization you have (another distinction). And what point is there for utility and usefulness, there is no objective only thoughts create this objective or goal
---MSG---
correct, when you think a thought it’s always in distinction. I think that I need to do this task, that there is a distinction of “me” and “needing to do the task”. Then we also add on things like I need to do it in a week and this creates another distinction of the future. these distinctions or labels only occur in thought. Another clear distinction is “I am this body” and the world is separate from me. So that woman who is walking the street is separate from me. This external world is separate from me is another distinction of thought
---MSG---
you can only think of this imagination and force the distinction of the scenario
---MSG---
it’s just imagination from thought
---MSG---
what gives rise to wanting to stop other people? you’re imagining a situation which isn’t real when you say that scenario of getting beat up in the streets. It’s not real
---MSG---
this is just another label given, where there is distinction in nonsense vs sense
---MSG---
the more you stop yourself the more thought is given to the stopping. You want to stop because you feel pain, but that is just thought given now to that stopping. It’s thought attacking another thought both of which aren’t experienced for they are the past
---MSG---
please don't aim for this as an objective either for what you are is what you are, there is no need for an objective or something you *should* do. But this is a reflection
---MSG---
whether asking here or asking yourself, you are asking and enquiring but only will the enquiry take place if there's a removal of the past. There must be space or some freshness to the enquiry. If i asked you 'who am i' and you've come up with some pre-planned answer or memorization it completely defeats all self-enquiry. When i ask 'who am i' i completely get stumped everytime for there is a freshness to the question being asked. Really really question deeply to the core without any past (even though it's difficult or not feasible) to the question. I doze off a lot and just ask it to myself quite often and when i ask it it's like a child being asked a question
---MSG---
are you the image? no, you are not the image for this implies identification. the tv is never the image on the screen for it just displays what is apparent on the screen. When one sees the mountain one is not the mountain but there is a sort of intrinsic connection (connection applies distinction but for the exercise we'll continue) to that mountain for its being displayed on the screen. this is all to explain that you are the sensory information you perceive for that's all that's happening now. you are perceiving this mountain (it's a label but please take it as just a sight for there is no labeling when you view something), that's what you're seeing and in that moment that's all you're seeing. Maybe you hear birds you are now seeing the mountain and hearing the birds. that's really it. These are the images 

Does the self exist i just can't observe it? The self is the one observing there is no observing the self, the self can only experience now when there is a cessation of thought

The only way I would be able to observe it is in thought, but nothing in thought is truly it, I can only guess at it. - yes you can only guess and even this guess will not even get close. If it won't get close then why guess further, for thought constantly cycles the thoughts that were already there. You can try thinking through thought but thought will never uncover completely, the totality must be experienced. So can one do something other than thought? 

```The mind consists of thoughts. The
“I”-thought is the first to arise in the
mind. When the enquiry “Who am I?” is
persistently pursued, all other thoughts get
destroyed,```

What does the conclusion of a thought give you? When we think of something and that thought ends, that's what we call a normal thought. When it sticks is when there's a strong identification to that thought. That thought is something of the past, it's not real so then why does it stick? It sticks because of the identification to the body/mind in some way.
---MSG---
*all of these images arise from yourself, there has never been a moment when the image has not arisen from yourself*
---MSG---
"I have this thought/object" is simply saying that the image of you has something, what does it have? there is nothing to have and there is nothing to take, all of these simply appear as an image and that's all
---MSG---
let's take the mind or the body, are these who you are? If these are not who you are, why strongly associate with them? going into these you'll realize and then to the core ask "who am i", hold onto this and you'll realize it cannot be broken down further for all thoughts/images arise from this source this pure awareness. It doesn't ever 'have' any of these for these cannot be attached, they just arise and they arise now
---MSG---
has any image you've ever seen through any of your senses been apart from yourself? Let's take the mountain, the curtain, the beautiful girl that is walking by
---MSG---
all you've done by saying "i want to be self realized" is created a chasm between you and the self even though you are what you are. And this chasm is itself another thought, another distinction that YOU have created within thought. And the destination being separate from you is *another* thought you've created is apart from yourself. From this you've created the problem, you've created the world in which this problem exists, and you've created the "solution" which is something like no problems or perfect happiness or something or a separate world in the form of a goal or something that needs to be attained
---MSG---
```But instead of setting about saying there is a mind, and I want to kill it, you begin to seek the source of the mind, and you find the mind does not exist at all. The mind, turned outwards, results in thoughts and objects. Turned inwards, it becomes itself the Self.```
---MSG---
is self external to you? wanting to be self realized assumes that you and the self are separate which is a distinction created from thought. There is no distinction, there has never been distinction, only the mind creates distinction and you associate yourself as the mind/body
---MSG---
you're asking a thought to clarify the other thought when in reality is there any need to clarify the thought in the first place? The thought itself is a slice of the totality that you're trying to understand, can you understand through asking  further? Is that not just another thought?

"Who am I" really displays all that is needed, what are you attempting to do when you ask 'how can i go further'? who is this 'i' that wants to go  further
---MSG---
these are all thoughts that you're thinking, thinking they're some external object is just you creating distinction
---MSG---
the "past" isn't some external object, the "previous images" in which your brain has thought has always been now. Has the past ever been separate from you? Are you different than this past which you're thinking?
---MSG---
yes how can there be separation created without thought, for thought creates all separation, distinctions including the body, the mind etc. everything now is everything now, saying it’s *part* of our experience is once again creating distinction. it really is just one thing, there is nothing separate ever
---MSG---
```Therefore, when the world 
appears (to be real), the Self does not appear;
and when the Self appears (shines) the world
does not appear.```
---MSG---
for there are distinctions still present such as "my body" and "my toe"
---MSG---
what you are describing is just focus through thought
---MSG---
i love how capy mentioned this specifically also ```Get really good at watching your thoughts appear and disappear in whatever capacity. What does it look like for a thought to disappear? What does it feel like?```
---MSG---
i will have to quote ramana once again as his response was just a beautiful expression 
> If you hold this feeling of ‘I’ long enough and strongly enough, the false ‘I’ will vanish leaving only the unbroken awareness of the real, immanent ‘I’, consciousness itself
---MSG---
here's another perspective from krishnamurti: "you may be telling the truth or you may be making a false statement, i don't know. Cause i'm not going to compare. I just listen. Which means i'm giving my total attention...i give my total attention to what you're saying, then it doesn't matter what you say or don't say"
---MSG---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8MLEssSNwM&t=4642s
---MSG---
For these are all images displayed on your screen, is it not?
---MSG---
at it's core it's about seeing what's apart from yourself. There was some latent but unrealized perception I experienced that i was apart from my parents, family, friends. That was entirely due to the perception that I was this body and everything external like the "wall" or the "curtain" or "the chick on tinder" are separate. Even the thoughts of which I was thinking them as there is this me and the thought is an external object. But only the mind creates this externalization of objects, it just creates it instantaneously that sometimes we might not observe it as so. I really like Ramana's thoughts here which was posted yesterday:

```But instead of setting about saying there is a mind, and I want to kill it, you begin to seek the source of the mind, and you find the mind does not exist at all. The mind, turned outwards, results in thoughts and objects. Turned inwards, it becomes itself the Self.```

So is that person picking out fruit at the grocery store so different than you? is that sun which sheds light any different from you? Is that pungent smell from the trashcan any different than you?

am reading this from the translated version of "who am I" from Ramana https://discord.com/channels/1129343306485215342/1131306781281353869/1258914712297410720 and am enquiring what he said here
---MSG---
From ramana
---MSG---
```The degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress```
---MSG---
every thought in every direction, it’s as if the self is being thrown around and buckled down to the constraints of the body and mind. The Body is currently physically sick, but when sleeping there is no sickness observed. The sense of the body and thoughts of the mind only come back when awake after the brief period of no thought.
---MSG---
really interesting to observe waking up every morning before thoughts rush in, but the mind is so raw in the morning that there’s always a flood shortly after as the mind is built to think
---MSG---
why is there any internalisation at all? is it possible to experience without internalising? for the internalising is another concept/division which arises through thought and more importantly your identification to that separation that reality is internal/external. When we think internal/external there is an association to the body that "i am my body" and things are external of that body like the couch or curtain you see. But thought feels much different for the curtain doesn't affect you intrinsically the same way.
 
So let's get to the core, why do we point? What does pointing do for you? Is that pointing really you? if it's not you why is the image on the screen constantly a massive tsunami smothering your entire existence? We see the curtain, then we think of the curtain and it doesn't bother us. But when there is a traumatic experience and we think of that experience now we feel some way about it due to some attachment to that experience and the labeling of that experience which we think of is in the past (another label). And every future occurrence that we can try to imagine will never happen as you can't imagine it, for thought can't experience the totality. You think that you point, but are you that pointer? Why is the pointer even there in the first place at **all**? If I ask who's pointing and you say "I'm pointing" please question deeply who is this "I" that's pointing.

The more I'm experiencing the less I'm capable of truly writing it out for it seems like a response acts as a prescription to do this or that and it doesn't even come close to what is actually experienced. Ramana loves to ask "who am i" because if you truly break it down, every small detail will always come down to this question for every thought "you" are thinking or every object "you" are seeing. One question I've also enquired about is "what exists apart from yourself" and hope it can assist with enquiry as well
---MSG---
lot to unpack. what do you mean by internalise? what is creating this "internalisation" vs "externalisation"? is there anything internal or external to you?
---MSG---
looking back at this image, the only thing i would change is that there's no distancing between the "me now/experience now" and the memory in the "What's actually happening" scenario. for the memory is being displayed on the screen and you are the screen in which it's being displayed upon. Something along the lines of encasing the memory within the "me now". a bubble within a bigger bubble. The thought is not separate from you, the curtain is not separate from you
---MSG---
is there anything that exists apart from yourself?
---MSG---
what exists apart from yourself
---MSG---
explaining it would be futile without the experience enlightening the way. first question would be "who" is looking at the blind?
---MSG---
when i look at the blind how is it the blind is separate from the seeing, there is no separation
---MSG---
truly a distinction is at it's core a separation for there is no separation in the first place regarding existence
---MSG---
for the sight is the object and only the mind creates objects
---MSG---
it's really the thinking without the thought, the seeing without the sight
---MSG---
```But instead of setting about saying there is a mind, and I want to kill it, you begin to seek the source of the mind, and you find the mind does not exist at all. The mind, turned outwards, results in thoughts and objects. Turned inwards, it becomes itself the Self.```
---MSG---
really such such powerful description
---MSG---
"The result will be the conclusion that the objective world is in the subjective consciousness" and "objects are only mental creations" just so powerful. Even the sights that we see that we think are "objects" are not truly objects at all really until we categorize them with the outward expression of the thought
---MSG---

---MSG---
indeed
---MSG---
this struck very deeply
---MSG---
```How then can the benefit be made lasting? It is by finding the cause of misery. Misery is due to the perception of objects. If they are not there, there will be no contingent thoughts and so misery is wiped off. ‘How will objects cease to be?’ is the next question. The srutis [scriptures] and the sages say that the objects are only mental creations. They have no substantive being. Investigate the matter and ascertain the truth of the statement. The result will be the conclusion that the objective world is in the subjective consciousness. The Self is thus the only reality which permeates and also envelops the world. Since there is no duality, no thoughts will arise to disturb your peace. This is realisation of the Self. The Self is eternal and so also is realisation.```
---MSG---
```The realization that self-knowledge was created only to know itself, but it cannot do that, causes the structure to dissolve because you immediately realize it cannot fulfill its funciton in any way.```
---MSG---
in what capacity are you creating this distinction?
---MSG---
you can never use a description to experience the totality of just that, experience “I am”
---MSG---
thought cannot be experienced, they only point. You can never experience what the thought is pointing to you can only use a description (new thought) to point to the experience as experience is the whole and thought creates distinctions which are never experienced
---MSG---
I am
---MSG---
I *am* enquiring the thought right now. For the image on the screen is displayed just as the question is displayed on the screen.
---MSG---
you're doing great, thanks for your follow up. We're enquiring together
---MSG---
what about laughing or joy, does that not affect you emotionally now? The really interesting thing i've noticed is that laughter doesn't have this innate ability to stick like what we classify as a "bad" emotion like sorrow, fear etc. Maybe because there's no identification with that laughter/joy now.
---MSG---
i don't like using "moments" in plural form. maybe something better is "in discontinuous moment"
---MSG---
the "previous now" can only be thought when we think it *now*, it doesn't actually exist only the description (limited) does within thought. When we think of that previous now we're always thinking it now in discontinuous moments
---MSG---
in what capacity?
---MSG---
you've never experienced the past as in the chronological timeline of experience. you've only ever experienced "right now", always. memory is accessible due to our brains, thoughts are formulated from memory. these thoughts are stored in the brain and when you think them you're always thinking of a new thought to that previously stored "image" in the brain. or you can say "replaced with a new thought or perception" as jay said above.

When you say "our memory did not happen in the past", you're bringing in some conflicting points because memory is just a collection of "nows" and when you say "past" it assumes that the past actually exists (which it doesn't). Time is not continuous that we have a past, present, and future. Everything always happens right now and it's always been this way from when you were born. We would not have a single thought if we did not have memory/some reference to a previous thought. But you're always thinking of that memory/reference now.
---MSG---
past of course is also a construction within thoughts, it doesn't actually exist either
---MSG---
you are using data of the past (stored images) now, and that data can give you an indication (pointer) but it will never be what is happening now. the future is an imagination that you've constructed within your thoughts, it doesn't actually exist. We use these stored images all the time in what we want. You'd starve to death if you didn't have the intellect required to gather food and water by going down to the kitchen and eating etc.
---MSG---
love this phrasing
---MSG---
there must be thinking for a thought to occur, there must be seeing for a sight to be seen
---MSG---
you don’t need to understand anything about yourself as that understanding will *always* be limited. you can desire to enquire through thinking but you’ll see that the thought you’re thinking is limited as well
---MSG---
that’s just thinking again though. If you don’t do something that has hurt you, you are actively thinking to not do that again. Even if it’s reflexively. If there is a bear being displayed on the screen you first see a bear as your eyes take the bear as an input on the screen. Then the fear etc comes after in the form of thought like heart racing and sweating
---MSG---
when you’re understanding something you are thinking it right?
---MSG---
what do you mean “as long as the real “me” exists”
---MSG---
it's not that there's separation of you and the thought, but the thought is not you. There's this closeness but at the same time a distancing
---MSG---
you have thoughts, the thoughts are not you just as the image is not you it is just what's being displayed. When we think of ourselves in the past or future that is just an image on the screen being displayed as a thought. Say you looked back at yourself 10 years ago, what do you see?

it seems the neurotic mind is "i don't like how i look so i need to change something. let me lose some weight so i can look better for myself/others. let me hit the gym so i look good...Ah i worked out i feel good about myself and am feeling prideful of the work i put in...Oh no I didn't hit the gym today, the image i created of myself being this person who went to the gym and focused on looking better is shattered. I feel a lot of shame towards this body of mine"
---MSG---
yeah one seems like a prescription and the other seems like just what they want to do, although this is just imagination and we can't really know
---MSG---
should be renamed to something like "self-image improvement"
---MSG---
i've never seen any billionaire that does this "self-improvement" stuff, it's largely people peddling it to get some reward like money/fame
---MSG---
if one has a decision to make that decision can only be done in thought for it's only thought that can choose
---MSG---
that's just it, we can only wonder. It reminds me of when capy said that "sure lets see what happens"
---MSG---
```Once the doctors were about to cut some tissues from the tumor so that testing could be done on them. When they were about to inject a local anesthetic to dull the pain, Bhagavan refused it and told the doctors to simply cut and take what they wanted. The doctors protested, explaining to Bhagavan that the pain would be severe without the use of the injection. But Bhagavan again refused and told them just to do it. They cut into the tumor and Bhagavan winced in pain. The doctors said, Bhagavan, we told you it would be painful.

Bhagavan replied, "Yes, the body experienced pain. But am I the body?"```
---MSG---
one of the most interesting things i saw from Maharshi was that he denied anesthetic for a surgery that once took place. It really stuck when i first read it

---MSG---
yes refining is just thinking a new thought to “fix” that previously stored image of “you” which is just your “imagined self image”, which is just that, an imaginary image of your self which is not actually yourself
---MSG---
even if you were babbling nonsense it only matters in your own experience if things register deeply
---MSG---
yeah your self-image is not you just as the word is not the thing, it will never be you. Any thought given to that self-image is just thinking of that self-image, constantly perpetuating it but never truly arriving at what the self actually is. Just like a painting of the landscape is never the landscape. The painting is just the painting, the landscape is just the landscape.
---MSG---
and i really love this illustration which Jamie created a couple months ago
---MSG---
i really love the way capy phrased it
---MSG---
understanding understanding is just thinking thinking which is repetitive and it's really just thinking
---MSG---
why do you think SR is that?
---MSG---
i like this concept of "waking up"
---MSG---
"trying to understand ourselves" from what i can make of it can only be done in thought as the process of "understanding" is the thought that you are thinking of now. If one tries to do anything, that act of "trying it" is "thinking" for if you see you see and if you smell you smell, there is no trying there. We have 6 sensory experiences, anything beyond the 5 senses that we traditionally learn is thinking. 

When enquiring and understanding whether through communication of another or thinking to yourself you are doing just that, "thinking" and you are thinking now! The "thinking" and pointing via enquiry is towards that of deeply being aware of what is unfolding in front of you now. One does not have to think to see an object in front of you, you just see it and one does not have to see to think, you just think it. 

Understanding ourselves is the enquiry being made (which is limited as soon as it's a thought) to something which does not have any division of limited or unlimited (the **now**). Thought is just a pointer to the experience unfolding that you are witnessing now. 

So when he's saying "OTHER than thought" from what i understand (again limited lol) he is saying thought is limited and thought **cannot** be the solution itself because you just keep thinking new thoughts of previous thoughts. It can point but it can never be the thing. "The word is not the thing"

*take a shot every time limited or thought is said*
---MSG---
"figuring out" can only be understood with thought as the act of figuring is something that we are thinking. If you lost the ability to think you would become a tree or flower. Just sensory perceptions without thinking (to our current understanding of how tree/flowers operate). 

You would see, hear, smell, taste, and touch just wouldn't think. Sort of like a vessel
---MSG---
good way to put it - the sense of self dissolving is just you thinking directly
---MSG---
you could say it was a "previous now". Memory is just a collection of "past nows" in which we're thinking of them now.
---MSG---
the feeling of "bad" is also a thought
---MSG---
whenever you're thinking of that memory/remembrance, that is a "new" thought that you are thinking to recall that memory
---MSG---
we utilize 6 sensory receptors - seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, and thinking. How does remembrance feel to be outside of thinking?
---MSG---
what do you mean by reconfiguring?
---MSG---
how it operates is a good way to put it
---MSG---
I’ve also experienced a complete shutting off of thoughts with the question, but if the mind wanders it wanders. I’ve always been curious why we move away from neurotic emotions being displayed on the screen. Is it because of a motive or desire? There’s certainly not two of you but even if you think there’s two of you that’s what awareness is aware of. That’s the now in thinking of it
---MSG---
when we are thinking of the thought that is also the "image on the screen" so is there any need for grounding at all? Even if we go down the "thought train" and let it carry us is there a reason to carry us back to the "present moment" as the present moment is the thinking of the thought
---MSG---
When i use the word "then" it's largely for semantics/description, the "then" is just imagination for you can only experience what is happening **now** including that imagination
---MSG---
to think "that cat is cute" you must know conceptually what a cat is, concept of cuteness, the order in which the words are etc. But we don't dissect it so deeply when we say those words, we just use them. These are descriptions pointing to the thing. If you think the cat is cute that is what you're currently thinking. Then the desire of wanting to pet the cat takes place. Then the fear of it biting takes place. Each of these happen *now* for ordering implies there is a continuity of which time (past/future) does not have ordering. Time is not continuous to our being, there is only what is happening **right now**
---MSG---
it's not a chain as in continuity moreso you're currently thinking of the thought right now
---MSG---
each thought is a "new thought" of a "previous thought", when you think of thought 1 that is just a new thought referring to the "previous thought"
---MSG---
when we communicate all we can do is point, for the person hearing/reading the communication will visualize the thought on the "screen" but that will also be pointing when understanding what is being communicated. Every thought is a "new thought" pointing to an "old thought" or previous memory for it is cyclical in nature as we can only be thinking *now*
---MSG---
correct, any form of communication is limited in this way. For any time you define something, it is limited. When you say "imagine a pink elephant" it's limited as you are communicating a word which points to the thing of "pink elephant". When you experience a pink elephant that's all it can be, but the word comes after when categorizing/identifying it
---MSG---
elephant is the word, for the present experience/SR doesn't have words to contain it as words are limited
---MSG---
but that encapsulation of a pink elephant is still limited for it is not the thing, how can the thought/belief be the thing?
---MSG---
but in those words/thoughts/new beliefs they are still limited
---MSG---
I would say I did not think about a majority of "self-image" before everything really settled in. I went on my life thinking everything was the volcano and just ignored it. Going to the gym or work, there was a constant conflict of a couple emotions including pride, envy, insecurity, competitiveness, anger. Now any time there's any sort of conflicting feeling I just sit with it *on the spot* and the resolution has gotten quicker from when I first started to look at things this way. In the beginning everything was so raw that the questions would be quite a lot lol.

To get to this state though I did not sit with my feelings and ask them, everything really narrowed and then immediately expanded from the "now". There was no attention given to the self *or* self-image in the first place really, that understanding came afterwards. Understanding the "now" to the truest deepest level. Knowing the limited nature of thought and how new thoughts just reference old thoughts and the cycle is an endless repetition takes you away from what naturally is. The cycle is being displayed on the screen but we imagine ourselves/awareness/self (whatever you want to call it) to be the cycle and cling so closely to it
---MSG---

one talk i really enjoyed was this one by Rupert and the image/screen analogy really resonated deeply. It's been mentioned many times but the walking through of it
---MSG---
beautiful way to put it
---MSG---
i've noticed this stickiness that awareness brings about, with the stickiness ever more present in thought/emotion. When looking at a tree there is no stickiness at first glance but immediately after thought comes in and starts conceptualizing and so forth
---MSG---
it always comes back to what is happening now, all the conceptualization recedes or more importantly the awareness just pictures the image as it is directly on the canvas.
---MSG---
what are you trying to transcend and what are you trying to acheive? going on reddit is what you're doing, why is there this notion of brainrotting or horeshoe on top?
---MSG---
i've noticed "doom scrolling" and driving are two times in which this perceived thought doesn't occur. the first being something people want to stop for whatever reason and the second people are largely indifferent to. Emotions could be there but they're not concentrated as strongly as when that "movement" stops. The same thing could be said for any escape such as video games, work but some are perceived as "dutiful and good" and others are "bad and a waste of time"
---MSG---
I find this funny because it's always the question that is asked on every ruminating thought there is for me
---MSG---
so if "you" doesn't matter why do those issues you've discussed matter?
---MSG---
even if it's immediately present there can only be that conflict. So can it be a conflict at all? If we go into the memory of that conflict there is separation but that pervasiveness *is the image*. We can identify it as *evil* and *good* but even this identifications are itself the image being displayed
---MSG---
i found this response so funny
---MSG---
even if the self image is conflicting with itself or has any feature of conflict, if that is the image being displayed on the screen that is all there is so even in a state of conflict that is still all there is
---MSG---
I'm wondering if there's even trouble with this at all?
---MSG---
yes, lovely way to say it
---MSG---
people don’t use words correctly to point to the experience which is where the follow up questions/further enquiry of the thought takes place. He uses negation to draw out that the description is not the correct translation of the experience itself (words cannot be, but they can point of which capy utilizes negation to do so). @_diaso_ can correct me here
---MSG---
proper use and misuse?
---MSG---
thanks for the clarification
---MSG---
I can see this
---MSG---
is it the belief that without negation these concepts can’t be communicated as strongly?
---MSG---
I wonder if words can point to the things why use negation at all?
---MSG---
indeed
---MSG---
even though the negation itself only exists within thought/conceptually
---MSG---
makes sense
---MSG---
for the word itself is just another pointer but that’s what communication is limited to as all communication is
---MSG---
can it even be communicated?
---MSG---
how does one communicate the “something” without words/concepts?
---MSG---
even the conceptualization of all this is quite limited, there’s no way to explain any of this at all. There is no cessation of thoughts. With one’s eyes open are they “trying” not to see? There is no try at all. One sees, one thinks, one hears. Thinking any of these objects are not on the screen and they are outside of the screen creates misunderstanding as the thoughts and “external” objects only appear on the screen
---MSG---
getting to the root one realizes that the “who” that is thinking the thought ceases all thought creation. Observing the thought itself is just an observation, there is nothing that sticks just as observing a color doesn’t stick. But when one observes a thought that sticks, one can realize there is some identification with that thought. Understanding the identification is meaningless as thinking will just create another thought for this understanding.
---MSG---
if one pays attention to thoughts and the rise of thoughts, one realizes they are there, but even thinking of those thoughts just creates a new thought right now. how can there be a complete observation of thought without questioning who is the thoughts arising from? Evaluating separation of thoughts or a closeness to the thoughts is just another thought so it’s by definition limited and cyclical.
---MSG---
moderation/self-discipline assumes there is a need to restrain. If one wants something they want it. Why does something like moderation exist? Is it to prevent desire from taking over? Monks who prevent desire completely and focus on not desiring still fall under the same paradigm as those who indulge to the maximum partaking in pleasures of all desires and those who want to fall in the middle of not too much and not too little. The extremes are constructs that we've equated as "bad" when in reality they are you acting from thought. There is no label to be attached to the action, it seems quite repetitive and taxing on the brain.
---MSG---
thank you
---MSG---
"be kind to the thought" really opened up everything Julien
---MSG---
i wonder if it can be *taught* at all, as most teachings would just be embedded as memory that constantly is remembered instead of realized
---MSG---
yes self-image
---MSG---
*be kind to the self*, I believe there's such an emphasis on the self being the cause of suffering that we don't just step back from it all
---MSG---
*be kind to the thought* what an absolutely beautiful way of putting it
---MSG---
amazing
---MSG---
just as beautiful as those trees, or those blades of grass, or that sunset
---MSG---
thoughts ***are*** gems, arent they
---MSG---
the act of envy, greed, sorrow, fear, anger are all just labels that are attached to our self. We "should" not be greedy. Well greed is a title we give ourselves. If one thinks they are not greedy that falls in the same umbrella of greed and that in and of itself creates a cycle of greed/not greed. Constantly shifting from one to the other.
---MSG---
What jaimie said here resonated with me deeply "You are yourself, and inherently cannot fuck up being yourself,
everything you do is yourself."
---MSG---
I understand what you mean now by "acting out of conformity to an idealization of now" because when I explained that I was observing my surroundings this could be perceived as ignoring negative thoughts/any thought as I went into observing the surrounding rather than thinking of the thought/desire when in reality both are just observing what's there now. Either one is what you are doing and running away from it into the idealization of the now from what people describe can be destructive/cyclical in nature. It's truly interesting because when I got into my car and drove, I saw the trees and then when I thought of how far I was from the grocery store I just thought it. When I went inside the grocery store and the desire to eat the ice cream came up I just did that and then I just went back into looking at people's faces in the store and then going to the aisle. My mind is always just swaying to what's around me whether that's the "outside" or "inside", there's not a resistance/acceptance to *either*.  

There is nothing to judge as all judgement comes inside of the thought. The judgement of a thought is just another thought. Even if one judges that's also thinking which occurs right now. There is no idealization of the now because the now is all it is, an idealization is in and of itself just another thought (which the thinking of that thought also occurs now).
---MSG---
the separation of what?
---MSG---
can you expand upon "why does the separation occur in the first place if rumination still occurs"
---MSG---
Ignoring thoughts are under the same surface as thinking thoughts. If thoughts are there I think them, I don’t judge them of good or bad. I just observe them for what they are. Last night I was having some conflicting thoughts so I was thinking of all the different forms such as what I was thinking, what was going on, replaying the scenario in my head. 

Today I had a desire and went to the grocery store to get some ice cream. I never had conflict and just went. Along the way I just casually observed the trees and the surroundings. Even thinking of the thought is in the now so there’s no detraction or running to as there’s no duality in thinking, there's only duality in the thought. So if the desire came up as I got closer to the store there was no judgement just a flow of the thinking.
---MSG---
yet it's always coming back to I am thinking of the pleasure/want i'm never associated too strongly with this pleasure. Just got some ice cream and when i got the desire just went. Didn't feel good or bad to go. But even along the way, looked at the trees shaking gently in the summer breeze, the lamp lights etc and never truly locked in on the desire as in directionally
---MSG---
being stuck in an endless loop of questioning the desire/want takes an immense amount of energy it must be torture
---MSG---
desire and belief is built on past knowledge but it doesn’t mean to not to desire or belief just because it’s the past. You just desire/want without the extra label of “desire so bad or this desire is so good”
---MSG---
not sure if you feel it but every time there's a resetting there's this mini-burst of pure mental clarity similar to how it felt when I first experienced it all. It's happened a few times now. The colors return, the weight on the shoulders feels less tense, a tremendous energy follows. The deep association to the thought causes a burden which is relieved by just thinking back to "who am i"/what is going on right now. I've heard this anchoring effect from capy as well
---MSG---
*I just did this so it’s fresh in my mind* lol
---MSG---
there’s sort of a let’s play with what just happened, it doesn’t seem right and then just replaying the scenario, seeing what was going on in my head, and what was *actually* going on. See what the problem is and just see it for what it is. And as you do this you realize it’s more and more thought and that the thought is not you, the thinking is. The distancing in real time is just so real it’s an indescribable feeling
---MSG---
really great stuff tonight Julien
---MSG---
it used to feel like a gun shot now it feels like a little pinch
---MSG---
One thing is that the part that sticks doesn’t feel like “you” anymore, it’s tractable as it’s a production of thought. It’s not really “you”. You can interface with it, break it down, walk through the scenario and see what emotions arise from it, see what’s there.
---MSG---
“Finding out who you are all the time by directly asking who am I” is just so beautifully put. Just becoming “SR” does not mean becoming emotionless, just that if something sticks questioning everything about it until you wrap around to “who am I”. Really phenomenal stuff
---MSG---
for once we described the observation we are already away from what is
---MSG---
is a description not itself an abstraction for some thought
---MSG---
very interesting, what is a description
---MSG---
even down to the core, we are observing lines on a screen. We are observing the screen and we are observing lines on the screen, but our mind instantaneously converts the lines on the screen to words which contain meaning which are only understood in thought, they are not experienced once the meaning is understood
---MSG---
we being everything is again thought as there’s duality in thinking we being nothing. There just is, you are seeing, you are thinking. You thinking you are everything is just you thinking you are that thought. So again what is everything? If it’s the universe you are again thinking of a thought that is not experienced.
---MSG---
in what way is it part of the universe. If your phone is not in one’s observation, can it be in the now? it cannot, that is a thought of the past or some projection of imagination
---MSG---
the universe is a concept created in thought, it is not experienced.
---MSG---
how do you know it exists, and why do you think it exists? if one is looking at a wall the wall is all there is in the *now*. The universe is a thought that one is thinking in the now, but it is just that. You are the one thinking yourself in the universe/that there is a universe
---MSG---
what is the universe? Is that not an idea from thought?
---MSG---
is there thought without thinking? Is there a sight without seeing? You are not the thought but you are the one thinking, when observing there is no duality you are just observing what’s there. When we say everything what are we talking about? The sensor is observing the sense (sight, sound) in the now as that’s all there is. So what is everything to you?
---MSG---
Insists implies some force or will, so what is there that utilizes will? It's thought and the lack of will exists under the same umbrella of thought. This division will always continue with thought as that's all thought is able to generate. So when one is interfacing with thought and associating strongly to it, it will create stickiness. This stickiness will continue as thought creates cycles

What is there which just is? Let's move away from insistence all together as what is just there doesn't require the thought division of will/no will implied with insistence. It has to be something with no division, no ability to get cut or any alternative. It is the same existing that is always there. It is permanent, unchanged, and it is all you experience. How can existing even take place if it's not permanent, it must be permanent. There is no separation, this is not thought or some concept but what actually **is**. We get entangled with thoughts and associate that with our existence. I'm 25 years old, I live in this house. Is this really you? How does one know there is existence at all. Is it that i have lived for x amount of years and it's always been like this so it must continue?
---MSG---
practice implies time in a sense right, as in an imaginary horizontal time not the instant vertical time that we live in
---MSG---
can you capture it without thinking? If one says they “know” how do they know, what are they interacting with to know?
---MSG---
one referring to there is no thought without thinking
---MSG---
there is no distinction or separation
---MSG---
yes the one doing the thinking and the thought itself are all one
---MSG---
or is you the one doing the thinking, doing the seeing
---MSG---
I used to perceive whenever people said “you” they were always referring to the self. In this case pikachu. But you is really just the thought, sound, sight being referred to
---MSG---
it is the thinking itself
---MSG---
yes just more thinking now
---MSG---
for there is only the now when one tastes, there is only the now when one thinks. One can think of taste but one is not actually tasting
---MSG---
one can’t taste what’s not real, the future and past are both beliefs held in thought which one interfaces when thinking
---MSG---
Is there thought without thinking? Is there taste without tasting
---MSG---
There is no central entity doing all this, there is just attention given
---MSG---
so thinking is interacting with the thought, tasting is interfacing with the taste, seeing is interfacing with the sight
---MSG---
Or is it the *experiencing* is interfacing with the experienced
---MSG---
are the thoughts and emotions the experience itself. For one perceiving these emotions now is experiencing them now so how can they be part
---MSG---
so how can thought be wrong, how can it be avoided or drawn towards. It is there and that’s all there is, when one gives attention to thought there is no judgement or willing away from as the attention at the moment is the now
---MSG---
and the now being experienced cannot be separated from the perceiver as that’s all there is to perceive
---MSG---
For it is one’s own thoughts and sensations that is creating the now being experienced
---MSG---
Me being the now is a completely shifting experience
---MSG---
The way it’s been perceived is that the now is all there is. Sensations including thoughts are in the now. The now is permanent and all there is. Now what is the perceivers relationship in the now. Is it a part of the now or is *it* the now. When you say *part* that implies some duality/separation
---MSG---
the perceiver is the now. wow.
---MSG---
What do you mean by “you cannot be you”
---MSG---
At that point where there was no clarity in deciphering whether beliefs were actually real. One can interface with beliefs now but does that make them real.
---MSG---
the lack of registration for compliments or insult is clarified with time. When a thought arises it arises in the now and that’s all there is, but then there’s a sense of the past which is a belief and not reality
---MSG---
This framing of “which isn’t experienced, like “non-existence” was conflicting when I sifted through it and then your phrasing of time came into such relevance. For every single belief including the self that is experienced is the past which is in and of itself a belief
---MSG---
at this timestamp it's really such a deep undescribable clarity that is communicated
---MSG---
https://youtu.be/3QpZqgTqlEk?t=654
---MSG---
it's such a mechnical process to immediately rush to translation and understanding of the words
---MSG---
translation to understanding
---MSG---
it's almost as if one is reading/hearing and the translation is halted in a way
---MSG---
it's really such a different experience when one is observing text or words with this new perspective of just words rather than something else even understanding is blurred
---MSG---
clarifying "self image" and the "self" does indeed help with communication
---MSG---
and attentive to something like the self through thought/belief
---MSG---
there is no self in that moment of perception unless one is inattentive to the words being said
---MSG---
when one hears or sees those words the self is not even in play!
---MSG---
when in reality it's all just words, moving of the mouth to create sounds in which we've understood from memory
---MSG---
the registration is so immediate! the mind takes those words and creates this instantaneous stickiness which one carries
---MSG---
attachment implies duality when there's only a single entity in totality
---MSG---
it's such an interesting enquiry, even thought creates this attachment of the emotion/label onto the self. In reality when the "other" speaks, one only register words. That's all that's being observed is words in that moment when attentive, but the thought comes in and attaches those words so immediately and registers it to "something", even that registering is all thought which is not experienced
---MSG---
let's explore this registration. what is a compliment or insult from another or even from oneself
---MSG---
the one thing that i've seen creates an immense amount of conflict is this label. the label which comes into contact with the self, then the self becomes inflated. With this inflation comes a strong very deep sense of association. is the self really never experienced? Emotions and labels only exist because of the contact with the self no? The perceiver just perceives and the self with it's past/future experiences emotion
---MSG---
what do you mean by self ownership
---MSG---
can there be multiple?
---MSG---
so lovely
---MSG---
Can one appreciate just the words there on the screen? Or does one have to be in a state to truly just appreciate what’s there
---MSG---
one really fantastic insight was the “one occurrence”, such a brilliant way to put what all this is. You can’t really capture what it is with this succinctness
---MSG---
what do you mean by the memory of stairs?
---MSG---
When I used to go the gym I would purposely avoid looking at myself and to counter this I would over-look into the mirror as I was countering the counter-vanity, from one extreme to the other when it all sufficed under the same umbrella
---MSG---
one interesting observation is that one cannot be the body, one just is. So there’s this consistent observing of the body rather than being associated with the body. Observing the muscles rather than having association/attachment/pride/ or even hiding of the muscles
---MSG---
aren’t circumstances all within the now, how can circumstance be per individual. All thought, emotions, and circumstance is within the now is it not
---MSG---
absolutely beautiful
---MSG---
There may be attributes that you’re describing but there’s no other “now” there’s only the now that we are in. Those that are in self-improvement are in the now and the now is complete order, but one can observe these thoughts controlling the world leads to complete havoc, suffering, and constant cycle
---MSG---
in this case Dr. K, even if he’s leading his followers for “self improvement” that is still in the now so how can we favor or dislike what he’s saying
---MSG---
If one is in the now but the other is completely immersed in “self realization” is there any need for anything to change or be different
---MSG---
and associating so strongly to the thought
---MSG---
they can be in the now but have conflict as they are always stuck with the self and the past or imagination in the future
---MSG---
the other as in physical, they are part of the now but they do not have room even within the now
---MSG---
the interface is not meant to be as the now is perfect and as the other does not have any room for input
---MSG---
Ignoring the iranian, they look to chatGPT and “peer reviewed studies”
---MSG---
something that someone said as a response
---MSG---
If one is so deeply entangled in scientific justifications there’s no room open for anything to come in
---MSG---
from another
---MSG---
how does one interface with such mental justification
---MSG---
how does one even respond to these mental gymnastics of “We can’t just say “depression” we have to say like an index (like becks depression inventory) so we can say this is what Iranian”
---MSG---
yes but these emotions are not experienced at some point, when one understands that this is the creation of thoughts and the past and not the now of which is all there is
---MSG---
even if the self shows up in one or many different ways, it’s all the self and interfacing with it in the now is all the same
---MSG---
the lightbulb just is what is there, there’s nothing else needed
---MSG---
When I feel something such as “this person complimented me” this would give my “self” some pride. But this is all in the past image that I have created
---MSG---
it can be experienced only in the now, that we can process deeply. Thoughts don’t create different selfs but the same self, it’s just embedded within thought (past and imagination for future)
---MSG---
yes thought is both an action in terms of “thinking” and when referring to it can only encase the past and future of which contain the self in some way
---MSG---
maybe there’s an implying that the you in the “now” as you are is all there is. But the one that held/associated with the emotion, thought, is encased in this “self”. Or does thought contain the self
---MSG---
but is it not only the self which experiences those thoughts
---MSG---
is the self just thought, and is nostalgia thought
---MSG---
in what capacity do you view nostalgia. Is it directly with nostalgia or are you interacting with some sense of self there
---MSG---
one must dive very very deep into all of these issues, what obsession with the past is there. Why is there such a deep obsession
---MSG---
what makes them issues
---MSG---
what issues do you associate with mental health, let’s start there
---MSG---
why in a month, why not **now**
---MSG---
Ask yourself deeply why is time involved at *all*
---MSG---
expectation of time just breeds further distance
---MSG---
there are those who have taken a year and those that have taken entire lifetimes
---MSG---
why is time even involved
---MSG---
Why do you think it will take a year?
---MSG---
What thoughts do you want to replace
---MSG---
can improving thoughts truly help? If one is paralyzed from thought and uses thought to fix or replace it that is one perilous cycle
---MSG---
you leave the door open, let the sun come in. If the sun comes in it's alright, if it doesn't it's alright

---MSG---
brilliant
---MSG---
rather the awareness just encounters thought
---MSG---
can thought exist apart from perception of that thought? thought has to be this input and if there is no output then what
---MSG---
that's all there is, attending to it is perception of it
---MSG---
awareness
---MSG---
the now contains everything, it must contain thought
---MSG---
or moreso does the now contain thought
---MSG---
it's a very interesting point actually, is thought the now
---MSG---
thoughts are series of images in the past and imagination the future, is there anything other than thought?
---MSG---
one can be aware of thought in the now, but that thought itself is not the now
---MSG---
rather rejecting it is what creates conflict
---MSG---
one can desire, and feel it but that feeling is not the now, rejecting one's own thoughts leads nowhere
---MSG---
we can think of them in the now, but they are not the now
---MSG---
just know that desire, anger, sadness is not the now
---MSG---
if you desire then **desire**
---MSG---
what's your point?
---MSG---
humans eat, walk, piss, sleep. This is a fact
---MSG---
who or what is the doer? Is it one who does? does what? we walk, talk, breathe, eat is that what you mean by doing?
---MSG---
fear is there, anger is there, selfishness is there
---MSG---
why beyond? These indicate superior in some sense. Thought is there, birds are there, trees are there
---MSG---
why distinguish the thought as separate. why should you distinct?
---MSG---
it's all natural
---MSG---
thoughts are just there, just as the tree is there, or the flowers
---MSG---
if you are poor **be poor**

more like, do you put anything on top of the memory?
---MSG---
how do you assess the memory?
---MSG---
what type of knowledge is that?
---MSG---
one must have knowledge to perform technical tasks like at a job or creating some painting as in what colors to mix. But has any sort of knowledge truly done anything psychologically?
---MSG---
where has knowing more gotten you
---MSG---
why do you want to *know*, what is there to be known
---MSG---
this is the closest thing i've seen to how it is to just observe and live in the now
---MSG---
very complicated
---MSG---
how is that so, when you’re hungry do you think you’re hungry?
---MSG---
what do you mean by “in thought”? You imagine your senses in thought?
---MSG---
communication through pure text is quite similar to the books available out there, one has to feel deeply to the core to realize it all. One thing the gita said is to not enjoy the fruits to the labor, when in reality the fruits is imagination in the "now" and not real and even the labor being presented is just the "now".

why not have a *freshness* is the core point
---MSG---
this is a very deep profound thing that your history of "not being able to be helped" has caused you suffering

now why is it of course that thought causes this, don't just say it but go deeply there

do you want to fly like a bird? one could fly like a bird if they jumped off a bridge with decent height

---MSG---
let's dig together
---MSG---
let's walk through it, there's no other way. why have this bias that you won't understand it
---MSG---
just notice it and observe it, observe all there is. if it's a deep root then dig deep
---MSG---
once you unearth the roots, the feeling/thought just crumbles within your palm. There is no desire to get rid of it or to go towards it, just as there is a tree there you just notice the feeling
---MSG---
just as one looks externally to observe the beautiful trees, flowers, and birds chirping in the distance. one can look internally in this case it's "that it won't help in any way". Dive deep into the underlying roots of that thought and uncover the feeling. What is the feeling there? What is it. What is the feeling.
---MSG---
there is no sensei or teacher, conformity leads to direction and direction has confused humans. The more "teachers" there are the more the world gets corrupted
---MSG---
**it is permanent**
---MSG---
in what way can you be fully aware of some idea that it won't help in any way. this is a projection of the mind associating with what it can or cannot do which is taking away from what the *now* encompasses. Please sit with this, just sit with it. Don't judge it, don't understand it, just look at it
---MSG---
```you actually do nothing to it. it is permanent and unchanging. there is nothing absolutely that you can do, think, or see that changes or affects now, they are all one and the same```
---MSG---
There is an immense beauty in the phrasing and construction of this
---MSG---
this is a delicate point because you're asking "how" as in being able to replicate it or a step in a series. Even if one explains the experience there's no telling the thoughts that can come in and grab that realization as just another saying someone said. One note is there was no search or wanting it. Just watching Krishnamurti and observing thoughts, emotions, external world, and internal world
---MSG---
any person in this world can fool themselves with various emotions, happiness implies sadness and humans oscillate between the two immensely. Always chasing after happiness and away from sadness
---MSG---
Happiness doesn’t come close, it’s moreso immense clarity. In the past memories there was a sort of monotony and boredom, now even in the same room there is **life** with colors and immense beauty
---MSG---
or what is it to your understanding
---MSG---
what is SR
---MSG---
One thing to note is that thought can only be conceived in the now. Anything you think of can only occur in the now
---MSG---
Thought requires a much greater energy than simply experiencing. Smell the flowers, create the pottery, listen to the birds. Thought only impedes these aspects of the now
---MSG---

@import_pickle not Jaime but the question asked is interesting. 
When one is engaged in something one can act seamlessly. Playing a video game, sculpting pottery, making music, or creating a painting doesn’t require the self to act. One is simply making music or pottery, only when one thinks of the self does it create conflict. When utilizing the senses one does not judge at that moment of interaction. Unless the mind is preoccupied with thought during the interaction.

Will is effort and is not needed when playing your favorite game. You just play it. Maybe you don’t enjoy the result and that is a consequence of thought **impeding** on the pure interaction of *just the game*.
---MSG---
maybe i jumped ahead here. When one sees the tiger they just see the tiger, there is no reaction in the first moment. The fear then comes along after even if it's just a moment later after seeing the tiger. Back to your question, one does not need to imagine a tiger there and reacting, the tiger is just there. Just as one does not need to imagine a feeling, it just comes. So, how can one be sure that they feel is a deep insight. Humans can feel the deep pain of sorrow, pain, isolation, anxiety very deeply and this is understood universally. There is no need to be sure to feel as that assumes thought confirms the feeling which goes into an endless loop. To feel is just to feel, the only way to interface with it is just to observe one's emotions
---MSG---
there is no need to judge or think of the fear either, it just exists
---MSG---
yes let's dive into this. Imagination is a result of thought, thought is a collection of the past and these past memories create conflict within the mind. When one comes into contact with a tiger in the jungle there is no need for thought rather it's a fear that is deep down within the core. No need to think and no need to imagine, the reality reveals itself
---MSG---
importance is not the question, observing and walking through the question to feel deeply down to the essence is
---MSG---
is consciousness a program on the computer or **is** it the computer
---MSG---
is the inverse also true, does consciousness contain all of the now
---MSG---
it contains the whole of everything
---MSG---
it contains all there is and nothing there isn't
---MSG---
it **has** to contain it all
---MSG---
does the now contain all of consciousness
---MSG---
even thinking we are the now implies that we aren't just as thinking we are self realized means we aren't
---MSG---
so is it possible that there is no separation
---MSG---
are we the now implies there is a negation that "we aren't the now"
---MSG---
the question that comes up now is "are we the now"
---MSG---
even thoughts, anxiety, fear, separation, loss, sorrow
---MSG---
one gains such a tremendous amount of energy interfacing with *purely* the now
---MSG---
one can only interface with the now, even thought which implies an image from the past can only be interfaced with in the now
---MSG---
there truly is only the now
---MSG---
the framing of "now is always unfolding" and "you actually do nothing to it" has such beauty to it, even labeling the beauty does not uncover the true feeling behind it
---MSG---

opportunity not in the sense of result or advantage but the ability to observe deeply into that which you worry

where there is conflict there is opportunity for observation
