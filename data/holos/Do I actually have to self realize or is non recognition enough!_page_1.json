Anything that is created from this is just another identification or another object held through thought. You say you are \"awareness\" well then that \"awareness\" becomes an object to identify with. Any form of thought creates an inherent division and can experience be divided? Only through thought can division take place, but thinking does not require division, seeing does not require division and so forth. You somehow agree that you're \"awareness of sensory experience\" but that again is just thinking you're something. Remove everything, remove awareness, remove sensory experience, remove any form of division and identification and what remains?\n\nAs for \"do i need to realize who i am\", what realization is there really and what need is there to do anything at all? The trick being played is there is no realization of a \"true self\" at all, it's the removal of anything related to some self that is imagined in the first place. Whether you realize, don't realize that has no significance and based on the emotions and as Ramana put it \"unwanted thoughts\" you can see for yourself whether there is attachment or not.","timestamp":"2024-11-02T18:42:42.920000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":20,"userName":"holos"}]
