By creating an image of solution you are creating deficiency through thought, but what is there to solve in the first place? By thinking of a solution you’re just  creating an imaginary solution to an imaginary problem.\n\nNarratives are created right here right now. So when you embarrass yourself, or when you make a horrible mistake, or you have a lack your justification is simply a thought. It’s an imagination created from thin air about 1 particular interpretation. It’s entirely limited because thought only creates limits, it just slices reality. And then we latch onto that limitation thinking it’s accurate. But that is not the all encompassing reality.\n\nA person who feels lonely is entirely weighed down by his desire to not feel lonely. The person feels loneliness and desires to not feel lonely so he seeks a companion to fulfill that desire. Rather if you look at being alone you are simply alone, but loneliness makes you feel different than just being alone it makes you feel incomplete. Thus the desire of fulfilling the incompletion is what causes loneliness. \n\nThere is no error with loneliness, it is a feeling and feelings are never wrong. They tell you everything you need. I’m not telling you to change or do anything, I’m just asking you to look truly at what loneliness is and who exactly is lonely.\n\nCorrect it is not eliminating lack because the lack is just imagined. There is no lack that exists or has ever existed. There is only an imagined separation between your current state of lacking and the desired state of completion. If you lack money then you can get more of it sure, but feeling \ninadequate and lacking in an emotional sense is a different phenomena. If you said “I need money or else I don’t deserve another persons love” or something emotionally then that is a lack of which you require money to emotionally fill.","timestamp":"2025-11-03T15:31:13.198000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"745395430791315477","username":"juba.hu","avatar":"596e62ed926774f517d0162a9a894ab3","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"𝙟𝙪𝙗𝙖","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1434891064958910475","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1434571398210125834","channel_id":"1428677755909701702","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Looking for any justification is simply creating justification now through another thought. What justification is needed when choosing a bagel over pancakes in the morning? The only thing it comes down to is desire. Justification is always later, you could say that pancakes are too sweet but in that moment it’s entirely the desire through the mind that dictates what is wanted. \n\nSo any justification you create for the thought appearing is just a limitation placed upon another limitation. The whole thing is justification doesn’t matter, what matters is how you feel right now. If you feel good you really don’t need justification because happiness is the lack of problems, if you feel poor you need a lot of justifications for why you are in that poor state. \n\n> the content isn’t the only thing is there \n\nThinking only creates content and imagination. Even the “why” is content based. You are creating some justification for why a certain thing is the way it is, which is entirely a limitation placed upon that scenario you label.\n\nThere are largely 3 reasons why we do self inquiry, it’s because of either curiosity, we don’t feel good/happy, or we don’t feel complete. enquiry is supposed to bridge the gap of lack and complete, but you’ll find enquiry doesn’t add anything. It doesn’t complete anything because there’s nothing missing. Thus we must question what lack is right here right now?","timestamp":"2025-11-02T15:54:34.381000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-11-02T15:56:38.052000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"745395430791315477","username":"juba.hu","avatar":"596e62ed926774f517d0162a9a894ab3","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"𝙟𝙪𝙗𝙖","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1434533587310350466","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1434198937845366915","channel_id":"1428677755909701702","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"what underlying mechanism are you looking for?

When you think of one who would be fulfilled what would they look like? What is separating you between that which is lacking (your current state) and that which is fulfilled (the desired state). The only separation that can be deemed is the belief that these two states differ whatsoever. The lack is a thought of one that lacks, the desire is a thought of one that is complete. These thoughts exist here now of lack and complete and thus since these are all thoughts there is no where to hide or strive towards.\n\nActing correctly is just a thought of some correct behavior and judging the illusory self of lacking this correctness. \n\nWhat is loneliness other than desire to be with someone? It’s not that being alone is bad or wrong, it’s always the desire which thought dictates as not having reached the destination as lacking or failure. Rather if there was no desire to be with another there would be no feeling of loneliness. \n\nA fools errand would be to try to get rid of desiring as that would just be desiring to not have desires. But it must be assessed who are you that is being judged at all? Who said life is for anyone? Life just is and you just are.","timestamp":"2025-10-22T18:05:16.181000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"758602499573153803","username":"streamsurfe","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1428677755909701702","message_id":"1428677755909701702","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"holos"}]
