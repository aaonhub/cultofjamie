Pointers from thought only point to themselves, there’s nothing outside of consciousness ever. The concepts you outlay (Santa) do not exist in belief, but they also do not exist because thoughts do not point to reality as reality cannot be separate from itself. Is red ever experienced? If I say there’s a red mug, the concept is not the thing and red doesn’t exist apart from the concept of it which is again only constructed in thought entirely. Thus concepts are not experienced either. So the question is, what is experienced?","timestamp":"2025-02-21T21:15:36.234000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1342264988575989932","message_id":"1342601918370943018","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1342422142947688489","channel_id":"1342264988575989932","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"what is experience? when it is said beliefs are not experienced, why do you think a belief can be experienced? Let’s say there is a belief about Santa, just the act of believing makes it so that there is no Santa. That’s the whole structure of a belief, in that the emotional attachment supplants the actual reality. The point of believing in Santa means Santa is not experienced, if Santa was experienced what need is there for the belief. You could extrapolate this out for all concepts because concepts aren’t experienced either, they are divisions picked from non-division.","timestamp":"2025-02-21T09:06:19.876000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1342264988575989932","message_id":"1342268141291438146","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"holos"}]
