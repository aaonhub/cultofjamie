Flowing from the Mosaic.```","timestamp":"2024-08-30T15:40:48.475000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1278796913633656954","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Revealation","timestamp":"2024-08-29T19:22:23.108000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1278560536480583730","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"even what I would say is still created by you for it has to be processed by your mind for “my” words to be understood.

And you've never thought something outside of your thoughts right now. Even things that you think are not there, are **still** encased within thought that you are thinking it's not there. Also you say the instatiation is real, but how is the instantiation real, the instantiation is just another thought.

My mind was like a baby receptive to all sorts of information. So I adopted a largely plant based diet based on the videos I saw online, watched a bunch of people like krishnamurti, mooji, papaji, ramana, kapil Gupta. But then after a month or two of it just reverted to my work/original state. But at that point still kept eating vegetarian/went vegan shortly after. Really interesting how the plant based diet stuck and the “SR” stuff didn’t if you can call it that. \n\nBut then Jamie uploaded a video in 2023 and I was surprised but didn’t really look too deep into it, just watched one of his videos.\n\nThen in 2024 not too long ago I read the Gita and wasn’t satisfied. Really was confused by the fruits and the labor and how can someone do something without thinking of the fruit of it. Why did Arjuna even have the duty, why does it matter if he carried it out.\n\nThen I went back to a couple things like Tao Te Ching and still didn’t get it, watched a bunch of krishnamurti videos and still was confused. Then somehow the stuff that Krishnamurti said seeped into the brain and my mind became lucid/drunk and my head started pulsating specifically the back of my skull.\nIt’s just a belief, but I think this allowed my mind some space as the center of thought processing was confused.\n\nThen went back to Jamie’s video, still a little confused but added a lot more clarity. hopped in this discord and shortly after read something profound that caused the wave of realization to flood.","timestamp":"2024-07-17T18:17:44.873000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-17T18:21:56.402000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1263194829073154068","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"one sec pizza is burning","timestamp":"2024-07-17T18:05:16.276000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"336025577548939275","username":"toaster_with_wheels","avatar":"31f356ab95c90d407beb61c61acb6bb2","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"toaster_with_wheels","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1263194734332219465","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1263194560956203143","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I mentioned it in the VC with capy and some to Austin","timestamp":"2024-07-17T18:04:12.352000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1263194482522980415","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1263194405842714725","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"same, for around 4 years lol","timestamp":"2024-07-17T18:03:35.370000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"158367925068103680","username":"emptymalls","avatar":"514d6a9219fda97b83d81dfed0264e01","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Empty Mall","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1263194318244679721","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1263192410016452628","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"the question has to be asked repeatedly then, were you measuring to a previous state with following attempts?

People can say anything and if that causes you to realize then so be it but identifying first if someone is SR and then basing the knowledge given after that seems neurotic/too attached to the identification of SR. \n\nI’m sure you have your own intuition of who’s SR and that’s innate within what they say. Alan Watts was someone who proclaimed to not “be SR” but if the information resonates it does, same with a crackhead giving you information. \n\nThe main thing is you can identify SR vs non SR but the barrier placed is another limitation and thus it’s not necessary when intaking the communication.","timestamp":"2024-07-17T12:29:43.993000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-17T12:30:29.781000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1262954219552636938","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"tierless tier system","timestamp":"2024-07-17T02:09:10.496000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1262954162698850314","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"is there a tier with no tiers","timestamp":"2024-07-17T02:08:56.941000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1262954080737951815","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1262949001280491551","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"really anyone who claims they are SR aren't actually for the description is just a symbol, a distinction.

When the body is hungry it eats and then moves on, unlike this suffering when we do the \"external\" activity we are still in a suffering state and we strongly desire to be at peace.","timestamp":"2024-07-14T21:14:42.832000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-07-14T21:19:33.424000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1262153475882746082","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"you can desire to get out of the pain there's nothing right or wrong with that","timestamp":"2024-07-14T21:07:18.328000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1262153133342330962","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1262153394764906579","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"you are hungry so you seek food because the body needs food to survive, you can only define the utility of getting that food or eating that food within thought.

Even the thoughts of which I was thinking them as there is this me and the thought is an external object. But only the mind creates this externalization of objects, it just creates it instantaneously that sometimes we might not observe it as so.

When we think internal/external there is an association to the body that \"i am my body\" and things are external of that body like the couch or curtain you see. But thought feels much different for the curtain doesn't affect you intrinsically the same way.\n \nSo let's get to the core, why do we point? What does pointing do for you? Is that pointing really you? if it's not you why is the image on the screen constantly a massive tsunami smothering your entire existence? We see the curtain, then we think of the curtain and it doesn't bother us. But when there is a traumatic experience and we think of that experience now we feel some way about it due to some attachment to that experience and the labeling of that experience which we think of is in the past (another label). And every future occurrence that we can try to imagine will never happen as you can't imagine it, for thought can't experience the totality. You think that you point, but are you that pointer? Why is the pointer even there in the first place at **all**? If I ask who's pointing and you say \"I'm pointing\" please question deeply who is this \"I\" that's pointing.\n\nThe more I'm experiencing the less I'm capable of truly writing it out for it seems like a response acts as a prescription to do this or that and it doesn't even come close to what is actually experienced. Ramana loves to ask \"who am i\" because if you truly break it down, every small detail will always come down to this question for every thought \"you\" are thinking or every object \"you\" are seeing.

In the beginning everything was so raw that the questions would be quite a lot lol.\n\nTo get to this state though I did not sit with my feelings and ask them, everything really narrowed and then immediately expanded from the \"now\".

Playing a video game, sculpting pottery, making music, or creating a painting doesn’t require the self to act. One is simply making music or pottery, only when one thinks of the self does it create conflict. When utilizing the senses one does not judge at that moment of interaction. Unless the mind is preoccupied with thought during the interaction.\n\nWill is effort and is not needed when playing your favorite game. You just play it. Maybe you don’t enjoy the result and that is a consequence of thought **impeding** on the pure interaction of *just the game*.","timestamp":"2024-06-17T17:17:10.285000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-06-17T17:17:40.140000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1252108344940953611","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"maybe i jumped ahead here.

So, how can one be sure that they feel is a deep insight. Humans can feel the deep pain of sorrow, pain, isolation, anxiety very deeply and this is understood universally.
