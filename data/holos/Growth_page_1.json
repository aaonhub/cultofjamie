Right now there's a comparison between \"someone\" here and \"someone\" previously. If there is interest why does improvement have to be considered at all? When there is desire to do a task, involving comparison to a \"previous you\" that did that same thing doesn't need to be involved. There is no drive to get better, simply the drive to do what is desired to be done.","timestamp":"2025-04-19T17:52:57.118000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"455065309439590400","username":"shravan21","avatar":"fccb761842d477949e8200768d459a7c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ShravaN21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1362777034866032670","message_id":"1362777034866032670","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"position":15,"userName":"holos"}]
