For the average person that would make them significantly happier than for you. Thus it's not the meteor or the money that matters, it's the relief from the burden of your responsibilities.

What if you stored it in your home, but while you were sleeping someone takes it. There would be another burden of having it and then losing it. Thus we have to go to a place where we can admire what's there without constantly wanting to possess. Because possessions are another illusion, you don't possess anything in this world.

You can't get hurt if there is no \"You\" constructed in the first place so it makes sense.","timestamp":"2025-07-30T17:29:39.563000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1400166592872190053","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1400164394070966294","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"what do you mean?","timestamp":"2025-07-30T17:13:25.343000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"172965915237810176","username":"ahighlyinconspicuouscookie","avatar":"7fe6f667f3382306de5d24a365821c58","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"A Highly Inconspicuous Cookie","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1400156847700181184","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1400079007537696851","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"there is no incompatibility, thought divides even for those that you label as “SR”, this is just how thought functions.

We all talk in terms of past, present and future but, in reality, past and future are just thoughts we're having. Time appears linear because of our motion through space but, in reality, there is only one moment in which all possible configurations of space-time are true, simultaneously. This is why superposition is true. All configurations of space-time have to always be true for any one configuration to be measured, and, no, this does not mean multi-worlds or universes, just multiple relative perceptions/measurement/observations of a singular one where space-time can be configured differently, simultaneously. And the only time travel possible would be if another whole universe of energy was available to reconfigure the one we're in but you would not carry new knowledge, tech or anything else because the \"past\" configuration didn't have it, to begin with - which includes, possibly, your being.```","timestamp":"2025-07-01T02:28:52.635000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"video","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xk0kcK3YEY","title":"What Gravitational Waves Reveal About the Illusion of Time","description":"Gravitational waves can distort space and time, but their effects on humans are imperceptible unless the source event is catastrophic—by which point, it would already be too late to notice.

It’s inspecting what’s already there. These conceptions of lack such as a lack of career progress and not having what is desired is inquiry much along the same lines as going out on a beautiful field and walking around, but one has a negative connotation while the other doesn’t. it’s not that imagining a relationship is bad it’s that there is suffering because the desire of a relationship to “you” is unfulfilled. Inquiry itself is neither good or bad, the only thing that can be listed as negative is your own beliefs.

When inspecting that their god isn’t real there is complete denial because of the attachment already in place. \n\nInquiry is not setting out a solution or improving, it’s about questioning. Questions don’t have negativity, the negativity comes from beliefs that we hold about ourselves. It comes from unyielding curiosity about everything that is there. What are these words? why are words given weight? how are the words separate from me? what even is a word. You can inquire about everything because you are not separate from anything.\n\nIf you were in a relationship you wouldn’t suffer about the lack of one because the desire is fulfilled.

Mathematics is based on defined limitations, every measurement and theorem is based on numbers and extractions, it's not based on anything other than approximations and concepts.\n\nHaving a discussion with another is really just listening to sounds or reading symbols and interpreting those symbols.

Outside is a division or separation from inside, consciousness is a division or separation from non-consciousness. These are all separations because thought cannot perceive anything other than that.\n\n\"Doesn't exist\" is another concept that lives in the paradigm or separation of \"Exist\". Existence is everything that's there right now. Non-existence is also there right now because it's in the same axis as existence.

That information still has to be thought of for it to be processed that there was similarity in the first place.","timestamp":"2025-06-05T20:55:16.669000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-06-05T20:57:22.197000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"198977782989062145","username":"valkuren","avatar":"f9f28e9c6adcc21ded51fcb0fa196826","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Valkuren","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1380284939349659699","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1380236547705536603","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"spoiler!","timestamp":"2025-06-05T17:27:16.528000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"137219201852112897","username":"import_pickle","avatar":"004b086f58e6b3ff81732d29c7b73904","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Online Gambling Master","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1380228153536020600","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1379888727022899220","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"When stating \"I am experience\", it's repetitive because the first portion \"I am\" already accounts for experience.

You typically notice this when you wake up and feel fully rested or track it on your sleep tracking watch.","timestamp":"2025-06-04T02:19:41.097000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-06-04T02:24:23.231000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"198977782989062145","username":"valkuren","avatar":"f9f28e9c6adcc21ded51fcb0fa196826","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Valkuren","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1379644477265940623","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1379644233547386973","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"when something is experienced it's simply what is right now","timestamp":"2025-06-04T02:13:37.828000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1379643913203220480","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"what do you mean you've never experienced deep sleep? when ramana is talking about deep sleep he's just talking about a state where there isn't any worry or concern apart from what is here right now but during sleep (which you can only imagine right now until you're sleeping) which is the same exact state as right now.

The definition only comes once there is a taste, and when there is a recording of the sight. \n\nThis is different than reflecting because reflecting creates images by bouncing back, but this is moreso it's own construction.

Questioning one's own beliefs is a nearly impossible task because one can go around in circles infinitely, asking \"what's next\" and \"so what\". The thing we desire strongly is a \"click\" or a moment of extreme clarity, but chasing this goal in and of itself will never allow you to look at what is because you're always looking at something which is not (the click and more specifically \"me not getting the click\"). Behind every single inquiry is a goal of getting to a point where inquiry doesn't have to take place, something is wrong with me, I want the click etc. But why is a click so desirable in the first place, what will self realization do, why do you think there is mental suffering here at all?","timestamp":"2025-05-03T21:12:35.412000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-05-03T21:17:12.608000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1368331711670255657","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Subtraction in the sense that shedding an attachment was not one that needed to be added when discovering santa was not real.

if i turn away from it, and don't think about it, does it no longer exist\n\nthere is only a concept of a scenario. \"if i turn away\", \"don't think about it\", \"no longer exist\". This entire formulation which you've constructed is somewhere along the line of a 0 compared to the reality of a 1. It's an imagination that can only exist once reflected or projected upon. If you turn away from it, you turn away from it. Now you are away from it. There is never a scenario where you're not thinking about it, there is only a self referential thought about not thinking, which is still being thought of. You can't say you're not thinking of a red frisbee or box of cookies, you can't think of a lack of thinking because it requires thinking to take place. The contents of the thinking are entirely conceptual and thus the \"not thinking\" about a concept can only take place within a hypothetical concept. Lastly, no longer exists only occurs where there is distinction about a past and the current state. There is no such thing as no longer exists because it requires a recall and comparison of which are only prevalent in thought entirely. There is no, \"no longer exists\" apart from the concept of one that was once there which by definition is dead. \n\nAgain concepts are entirely held in thought, they point to themselves, they are not experienced because a concept is a separation from reality, that's what makes it conceptual in the first place.\n\n> reality holds up extremely well\n\nReality is not something which can be explained, conceptualized, or contained. Reality is not some consistency. What would make reality not hold up extremely well? If the tv behind you was once there (through this perceived past) and now it's not, would that make reality not hold up extremely well? What is reality in the first place.

only see activism as a way to raise awareness of that act. You can raise awareness for anything it doesn’t matter what, it’s similar to writing on discord or just sharing a song you like. I don’t want to eat meat, I don’t like killing animals and a lot of people I talk to don’t like to kill animals, I’ll show them what conditions the animals are kept in and how they’re killed. Or if the pleasure they receive from meat is greater than the life of an animal then funding some alternative cultured meat or technologically innovating to make it easier to have plant based options etc. \n\nIf I were to see a child torturing a dog in front of me I’d probably do something because I can hear the pain and the suffering of the dog. But if someone told me that there is a single dog being tortured in the Middle East right now there is not enough activation energy to go there and do anything.

With justice there exists a paradigm of “just behavior” or judgement upon that which is perceived as “wrong” and something as “right”. This is still the mind imposing a standard on an external world, how can one thing be right and another wrong apart from the feeling of it. \n\nThere’s actually a good point here, “what the lack of desire to kill animals has to do with eating meat”. It’s moreso the lack of seeking pleasure from the meat overriding the need to kill the animal to derive that pleasure. Whether it’s taste, nutrition etc. this paradigm of preventing further harm doesn’t really align because what further are you talking about. There’s the “past” image which you’re thinking now, the entire morality compass stems from this by referencing this “past” and this whole notion of some “future” is asserted from here. So any further is really just imposing the past to the future which is still occurring now, overall there’s no thought of any future involved here. It’s just a lack of wanting to kill the animal and moreso the imprisonment involved.\n\nWhether one goes for activism or not, both are ok and there’s no attachment to either expression. It seems that the biggest activism you can make is through technological innovation rather than protests or yelling at people to stop eating meat, although neither option is better or worse. Something like every time someone orders a burger show them that cow being slaughtered with the sounds of the animal right as they order it. Cognitive dissonance is big in this decision as you point. \n\nWho says I’m SR or anybody is SR, who is this label assigned to really? The label doesn’t make sense because there’s no individual or identity to point to, this is just a creation of identification through thought. If the decision is made to defend that’s ok and if there’s no decision that’s ok. Cutting experience in good or bad is simply a projection through thought.","timestamp":"2024-10-21T04:45:03.106000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-21T04:51:41.565000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1297328017475112971","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1297273602709655553","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"true, who in the first place is enlightened at all?","timestamp":"2024-10-19T19:02:09.064000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"352131792188473344","username":"pikachu_is_boss","avatar":"f62cee7117de3ae53a0b085853bf7073","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pikachu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1297272708517728380","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1297273126463475782","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"time and change is another model, which is another limitation along the same lines as any other model","timestamp":"2024-10-19T19:00:15.518000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1297272963258646621","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"economics utilize supply and demand, assuming this is the causal relationship that you're referring to.

There are animals being slaughtered across the globe but only through thought imagination can you perceive this slaughtering. You can go on youtube and look at videos but these are all just dead images being played. Indeed pikachu was quite prescient when saying this can be a good self-inquiry angle because anger can only be associated with someone or something attacking \"you\" or \"your ideals\" but these always start with \"you\". And more specifically \"your morality\" stance which is in odds of some perceived injustice that isn't being experienced other than your thought of it. Morality in entirety is just a limitation created from thought identifying good and bad which is just an abstraction from experience. It's not that there's denial of animals being killed, but there's no emotional attachment or emotional conflict here. \n\nIt doesn't sound like selfishness but rather an internal conflict of \"me\" and \"those who eat meat/kill animals\". If there is no desire to kill animals then there's no desire to eat meat, it's quite simple. \n\ni did not eat meat/dairy before and had some similar feelings, but i kind of put that concentration and anger towards building a product hoping that animal suffering would be resolved. This was clearly moving towards a solution in order to quell this anger/sadness. Now there's no emotion involved and i eat with friends that order meat/family that eats meat.  I'm still working on a product that conveys this all but it's not an emotional restriction.\n\nwhy is there a belief that your stance about this would change after SR or whatever this concept of SR through thought creation. Whether you eat meat or not is based on the desire of it. the only absence would be \"you\" and the emotional attachment involved. \n\nIt's simple, people purchase slaughtered animals and the meat suppliers will continue, if they don't buy it they won't.","timestamp":"2024-10-19T18:20:16.688000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"660785652622819328","username":"gamenightguy","avatar":"d1956ce65c9a5427819cdf01c5f18390","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Guy","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_5b1319abfc9f928479b68a73635f591d","sku_id":"1306330662965477478","expires_at":null},"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1005111919805476904","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"EVIL","badge":"b2898fb9792d06427ade956f7413cd27"}}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1129343306485215345","message_id":"1297127532235067442","guild_id":"1129343306485215342"},"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1296765085007482943","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Huel has 30g/serving, pretty good especially if you have it with whatever milk you want","timestamp":"2024-10-18T09:21:28.996000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-18T09:21:45.996000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1296764770913091617","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"I tried this and I didn’t like the taste/texture but that was like 5-6 years ago now.

There are no alternates for that. Let’s start with the first example, indeed if one was to get fired they would not have a job and thus what would that person do? There could be feelings associated with incompetence, shame, guilt etc. when placed in this circumstance it is not that there is thought of “who is the one that is homeless” but rather a detachment from these emotions that are undesirable. If one wants they will try to find a job, improve skills etc. the main thing is that one would undergo a lot of emotional havoc if they have attachment to the emotions and the other would simply look for another job without this baggage.\n\nNext example with rape, why does one rape another. What is the reason for subjugating pressure onto the external world and moreover an individual that does not desire the same act. It starts with pleasure, pleasure is the sole characteristic and getting this pleasure at whatever cost. What makes someone go to such lengths for acquiring pleasure, it starts with the thought that satisfaction can be acquired externally instead of internally. This can be said the same for money, status, power. If one was completely satisfied with what’s there right now what else is there to do, act, acquire, and subjugate.\n\nLastly with the concentration camp, if one undergoes extreme pain and torture physically the immediate reaction is to stop the pain and what is wrong with that? Characterizing this whole thing as this invincible physical pain dissolution is a misunderstanding. If intense physical pain is there feeling like it’s hurting every nerve in the body, of course you will attempt to stop this pain. One doesn’t need to have an imaginary person in their head to feel some large physical discomfort. Just think or see any animal that feels intense discomfort and torture, they will want resolve it as they yell and scream.","timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:45:14.639000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:49:23.976000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1296695455530356767","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"@river_rafter found your question really interesting and wanted to answer it here with the question in “am I the boobs”","timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:44:48.035000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:45:12.003000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"721388489115172924","username":"river_rafter","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"riverrafter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1296603455456149625","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"probably see the desires","timestamp":"2024-10-17T22:39:13.508000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"holos"},{"id":"1296602166299197440","channel_id":"1129343306485215345","author":{"id":"381561618833604610","username":"holos","avatar":"53e8b71a9a907739498059917ef9a290","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"holos","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"content":"Task force?

Let’s say you are growing up learning words.
