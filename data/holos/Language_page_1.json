One interpretation is that 'wrong' is \"dishonest\", and another is \"incorrect.\" In your example of going against 'intuitive understanding' i see this as a distinction between honest and dishonest rather than incorrect. We can say that 2+2=5, but this is clearly incorrect in that it can be argued against using the conceptual framework of mathematics. In the subjective experience when attempting to display something that is not aligned with your current circumstance, this will be felt as dishonest and misaligned. The part that's confusing is your comment on frustration. It seems that frustration arises because you're protecting something which is not necessary thus causing a larger expenditure of energy than is required.
