After a while I communicated the same thing as something like \"the cessation of emotional relationship to self-imagination\" which is pretty accurate, but I feel like maybe only around now I'd be comfortable being like \"ok, these expressions have settled with me long enough to write them into a book to share without wanting to change them significantly later\".",

There isn't a way to get rid of it because it already doesn't exist, there is only realizing that it already isn't there and that you are mistaking your thoughts for yourself.\n\nIn the same way how there is no way to get rid of Santa Claus, there is only realizing that he isn't in your experience already. It's already the case. It's already inherent to your experience."

The only reason I'm saying they're the same is because your whole life is in service of self-realization and self-actualization. If you use the metaphor of a sunflower, if I plant the seed, it grows into the flower. This is inevitable. If I give it a consciousness, perhaps it has some greater freedom, volatility, energy efficiency, etc, but it becomes a sunflower no matter what it does, that tape runs its course. You are the same way and whether you get it or not, you will act yourself out as a human being.",
        "Capy": "I would just focus on the reality of whatever you're inquiring about, since that's the only thing relevant to any inquiry. The claim that you're making is that there is a thought or statement which describes you, or, is you. First figure out how you know that or what the experience of that is.\n\nBe completely honest. Stick to what is already the case or inherent to your experience. Look for what is unchanging in experience. Before you think about changing yourself or saving the world or whatever, first figure out what is actually real and true and doesn't change.\n\nGet rid of all that is transient, and stay with what is present, intrinsic, and essential."

        "Jamie": "It's analogous in my own experience to how I used to and presumably most people would experience a dream. In a dream something really bad might happen, you get really scared, then you wake up and in 5 seconds you're completely fine. Why don't you have lingering trauma? Because you intuit \"that wasn't real, it was a dream\" and your brain automatically discounts it. If you say \"I am going through a breakup, and the image of this person in my mind hurts\" it is different for me (now) because there is not the \"added on\" part of hurt. Without an imagined personal identity that was hurt by another person's death, there is no change in your identity or imagination of your life, just an immediate change to what is happening in front of you. You can love someone in their last moments, then they are gone, and there is no sadness, just an absence of love.",
        "Capy": "Without thought, there is \"you\" which is experiencing something that can never experience loss.\n\nIf you're worried about tomorrow, yet you're not experiencing it, then any emotion or whatever else isn't caused by tomorrow, it's how the thought presently feels. The explaining of emotion as if it is coming from tomorrow or somewhere other than \"here\" is what keeps it looping."

        "Jamie": "The ultra-nutshell version is that your natural mode of operation is wanting to love. This is the complete fulfilment of intelligent function in relationship to your life as it plays out in front of you. Self-image or our ego is a secondary carbon copy of this literal brain function that is the belief we are an actual \"other\" person in thought. This causes a secondary version of the previous emotion set that demands we create conditions under which other people love us. This is an introduction to self-inquiry, which is the question: \"if you can see this, then how do you know other people love you other than your own invented standard?\"",
        "Capy": "The self-image is always a recursion. There isn't someone separate from self-image affected by self-image which denotes someone that has \"my self-image\". What you think you are is self-image. When you say \"it's because of my self-image\", whose self-image are you talking about, which is separate from the self-image? That entire thought is self-image, because it refers back to your previous thought which is also self-image.\n\nSelf-image recursively creates a model of a perceiver inside the whiteboard or blueprint which is being perceived, which is unnecessary."

        "Capy": "Past and future is equivalent to worry. Worrying about the past and future is the same as believing in past and future. It's the same idea/thought/belief.\n\nOnly what is in past and future can worry about past and future.

        "Jamie": "The beliefs an individual has don't make everything make sense, they try to make sense of things through forcing a relationship of \"I am not sufficient\" ----> \"my current experience\" -----> \"rectifying insufficiency with perfect solution\". An example with your mention of the need to be successful is not that there's anything wrong with being an athlete, or being a movie star, or being a successful business person, the only problem is the ongoing algorithmic brain function that operates constantly demanding it, which is ambition, anxiety, restlessness, and anger at your own failure to live up to your \"imagined\" solution to the problem. The problem in this case being not that you couldn't make more money or be in better shape and that would be cool, it is the artificial demand that has been invented by the brain that believes it is \"fixing\" something in time when it isn't.",
        "Capy": "You don't lose ambition or desire per se, but all that you desire is just exactly what is occurring right now, because that is the only thing you CAN desire.\n\nExistentially, you can't desire any THING, because to desire something it must not exist in your experience first. So, literally, by definition, all desires are about something that does not exist in your experience. Everything that can be sought exists now. The only thing to be sought is purely just the action of seeking something, which is of course redundant to seek.\n\nThis is not to say that desire is bad or redundant, but desire itself is recontextualized into something like a pleasant thought form that you are deciding to create. It can become unpleasant when you mix it with a belief that you are located inside that desire."

      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "I think the best analogy is that I don't ever experience anger related to ideas, but you do still experience frustration, which is a strong energetic demand from your brain to try to communicate an important idea you don't think another person is understanding. In the sense that if you are angry it is because you think another person is saying/doing something harmful, whereas if you are frustrated there is no emotion, but a forceful effort of communication to express the other person is not understanding you. Being angry feels like anger obviously, but being frustrated exclusively is just heightened energy towards a particular focus, like a dog who wants to get out of the car so it can run around.",
        "Capy": "It doesn't look like he is angry at anyone specifically, just \"people who ask that all the time\", and he basically goes back to calm right when he's done, so just looks like genuine frustration or something, not a grudge.\n\nAnger probably means you feel like you or someone else is in danger and it is the desire to neutralize whatever you believe to be the cause of that danger. Frustration is the desire to operate in two ways, because it is impossible."

The point of the phrase and what it represents conceptually is there is nothing else to feed into now. Ten years ago it was experienced by you as \"Now\". Right now you are experiencing \"Now\". In ten years you will experience that moment in time as \"Now\". You cannot experience \"everything feeds into now\" there is no other thing than now. The one and only thing in existence to you is present experience.",
        "Capy": "Thoughts appear in our experience similar to a stage with many props and actors. Everything has to occur together on the same singular stage, which is now. If it's not happening together, it is absent, and so it isn't there at all.\n\nWhenever you're thinking, you can imagine it as looking at a whiteboard in the present moment that is describing things. The world or reality or \"now\" gets immersed in its own appearance of divisions, but it is all appearing on the \"same stage\" of now. Like a whiteboard which says \"past and future\" requires both words \"past\" and \"future\" to appear together on the same singular whiteboard.\n\nAlso pay attention to the chronological limitation of reality, which is that everything must occur now. \"Past\" and \"future\" are like scaffoldings which always must be built on top of now."
