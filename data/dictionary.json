What he means and what I mean is that there is absolutely no other time that things occur. This is tremendously hard to reconcile because we view our lives as an 80+ year monolith of information. You have years and years of childhood and years and years of future life you will experience. I am saying, and he is saying, that you don't. You have exactly present perception. This includes present memory, which is those other things. You have present perception, which includes present memory. Present memory is your past and your projected imagination of the future."

        "Jamie": "The phrase itself makes perfect sense and is a great 'meditation', but at the time I didn't understand it conceptually at all as it was completely new, I was just talking to myself and thinking and it came out, but it triggered the physical event, and afterwards it made complete sense in hindsight. It felt more like someone saying \"look, there's the moon\" and consciously I was like \"ooooh...moon\" but your brain is like \"ok that's it we're becoming an astronaut but he'll learn that info later\". Not like there is secret info, but it felt like your own conscious knowledge is extremely low level, but that small insight was enough to trigger a much deeper and more intelligent brain structure to click and become aware of something.",
        "Ender": "Just going to share the thoughts I had right before the realization. Visual perception does not contain objects. You do not exist in visual perception because all that exists is visual qualia (this was while I was looking at a computer screen so it felt incredibly intuitive). It is not possible to see yourself, all you see is vision. Thoughts are essentially just another sense perception right? [click] Oh all that exists in thought is just thought qualia. You can't think about yourself you can only think about thoughts, and clearly you aren't a thought so you can't think about yourself."

        "Jamie": "There isn't an emotional relationship to an idea of presenting or what anyone is saying, but there is a focus/tension in relationship to the actual event as it's happening. Like there is a \"stress\" that I experience in the same way that asking someone out I'd probably be nervous. This isn't accompanied by anxiety or an emotion, but is a tense physical event containing uncertainty that you have to pay a lot of attention to because you perceive it as consequential/important. While in this particular case there isn't any emotional characteristic, it's not like you never experience emotions, it's that emotions occur when they are necessary in response to events that are currently happening, not towards imagined outcomes or events."

      "question": "Does understanding continue to evolve after self-realization?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "I mean I think it's just a continual progression of the same thing. While it's true that self-realization itself is phenomenological, the explanation of experience to other people afterwards and your own ideas about life are intellectual, so it's been difficult to evolve those concepts to share. An example is that I originally communicated the idea like one week after it happened as \"cutting the umbilical cord between thought and emotion\" and a lot of people thought it was like a mental break \"are you ok?\" type of thing. After a while I communicated the same thing as something like \"the cessation of emotional relationship to self-imagination\" which is pretty accurate, but I feel like maybe only around now I'd be comfortable being like \"ok, these expressions have settled with me long enough to write them into a book to share without wanting to change them significantly later\"."

        "Jamie": "You will feel whatever you feel as you figure it out. They are both the same, but to be more practical, yes you need to engage. The only reason I'm saying they're the same is because your whole life is in service of self-realization and self-actualization. If you use the metaphor of a sunflower, if I plant the seed, it grows into the flower. This is inevitable. If I give it a consciousness, perhaps it has some greater freedom, volatility, energy efficiency, etc, but it becomes a sunflower no matter what it does, that tape runs its course. You are the same way and whether you get it or not, you will act yourself out as a human being."

      "question": "Do you experience grief or loss?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "It's analogous in my own experience to how I used to and presumably most people would experience a dream. In a dream something really bad might happen, you get really scared, then you wake up and in 5 seconds you're completely fine. Why don't you have lingering trauma? Because you intuit \"that wasn't real, it was a dream\" and your brain automatically discounts it. If you say \"I am going through a breakup, and the image of this person in my mind hurts\" it is different for me (now) because there is not the \"added on\" part of hurt. Without an imagined personal identity that was hurt by another person's death, there is no change in your identity or imagination of your life, just an immediate change to what is happening in front of you. You can love someone in their last moments, then they are gone, and there is no sadness, just an absence of love."

      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "The ultra-nutshell version is that your natural mode of operation is wanting to love. This is the complete fulfilment of intelligent function in relationship to your life as it plays out in front of you. Self-image or our ego is a secondary carbon copy of this literal brain function that is the belief we are an actual \"other\" person in thought. This causes a secondary version of the previous emotion set that demands we create conditions under which other people love us. This is an introduction to self-inquiry, which is the question: \"if you can see this, then how do you know other people love you other than your own invented standard?\""

      "id": "what-is-the-root-of-discontent",
      "question": "What is the root of discontent?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "It's a relationship with your past, present and future. You feel discontent in the present because there is a previous \"wrong\" or \"insufficiency\" you want to correct, improve or achieve. This creates a present demand in the brain to acquire, achieve, or overcome something."

      "id": "is-ambition-bad",
      "question": "Is ambition bad?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "The beliefs an individual has don't make everything make sense, they try to make sense of things through forcing a relationship of \"I am not sufficient\" ----> \"my current experience\" -----> \"rectifying insufficiency with perfect solution\". An example with your mention of the need to be successful is not that there's anything wrong with being an athlete, or being a movie star, or being a successful business person, the only problem is the ongoing algorithmic brain function that operates constantly demanding it, which is ambition, anxiety, restlessness, and anger at your own failure to live up to your \"imagined\" solution to the problem. The problem in this case being not that you couldn't make more money or be in better shape and that would be cool, it is the artificial demand that has been invented by the brain that believes it is \"fixing\" something in time when it isn't."

      "id": "anger-vs-frustration",
      "question": "What is the difference between anger and frustration?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "I think the best analogy is that I don't ever experience anger related to ideas, but you do still experience frustration, which is a strong energetic demand from your brain to try to communicate an important idea you don't think another person is understanding. In the sense that if you are angry it is because you think another person is saying/doing something harmful, whereas if you are frustrated there is no emotion, but a forceful effort of communication to express the other person is not understanding you. Being angry feels like anger obviously, but being frustrated exclusively is just heightened energy towards a particular focus, like a dog who wants to get out of the car so it can run around."

    {
      "id": "present-moment",
      "question": "What does it mean that everything is happening now?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "My understanding, and to whatever extent experience, is that in a strange and very unintuitive way everything feeds into now. The point of the phrase and what it represents conceptually is there is nothing else to feed into now. Ten years ago it was experienced by you as \"Now\". Right now you are experiencing \"Now\". In ten years you will experience that moment in time as \"Now\". You cannot experience \"everything feeds into now\" there is no other thing than now. The one and only thing in existence to you is present experience."
