This isn't accompanied by anxiety or an emotion, but is a tense physical event containing uncertainty that you have to pay a lot of attention to because you perceive it as consequential/important.

An example is that I originally communicated the idea like one week after it happened as \"cutting the umbilical cord between thought and emotion\" and a lot of people thought it was like a mental break \"are you ok?\" type of thing. After a while I communicated the same thing as something like \"the cessation of emotional relationship to self-imagination\" which is pretty accurate, but I feel like maybe only around now I'd be comfortable being like \"ok, these expressions have settled with me long enough to write them into a book to share without wanting to change them significantly later\".",

An example with your mention of the need to be successful is not that there's anything wrong with being an athlete, or being a movie star, or being a successful business person, the only problem is the ongoing algorithmic brain function that operates constantly demanding it, which is ambition, anxiety, restlessness, and anger at your own failure to live up to your \"imagined\" solution to the problem. The problem in this case being not that you couldn't make more money or be in better shape and that would be cool, it is the artificial demand that has been invented by the brain that believes it is \"fixing\" something in time when it isn't.",
        "Capy": "‏‏‎ ‎\nSo, you don't lose ambition or desire per say, but all that you desire is just exactly what is occurring right now, because that is the only thing you CAN desire. The thought \"I want this\", and then the actions that come after that are all you desire, because that is literally the only thing that exists in your experience. There is a very visceral realization that you can't desire something that doesn't exist in your experience, it's just impossible. It is seen that the desire for something is something you just completely willingly came up with, and the pursuing of that is something you are also willingly creating, and the feeling of desiring and creating is all that is desired and can be desired.\n\nExistentially, you can't desire any THING, because to desire something it must not exist in your experience first. So, literally, by definition, all desires are about something that does not exist in your experience. So then, how are you desiring something that doesn't exist? Thought! If something is in your experience right now, you cannot desire it, so it becomes a catch-22. Everything that can be sought exists now. The only thing to be sought is purely just the action of seeking something, which is of course redundant to seek. The very action of seeking is all that you want, and so in a sense, there is nothing to seek aside from your attempt to seek something, and then this is where the idea of \"the enlightened person has no desires\" comes from.\n\nThis is not to say that desire is bad or redundant, but desire itself is recontextualized into something like a pleasant thought form that you are deciding to create. It's like daydreaming, or thinking of a cute animal, or thinking about a really beautiful picture you saw the other day. It can become unpleasant (current you reacts avoidantly) when you mix it with a belief that you are located inside that desire."

      "question": "What is the difference between anger and frustration?",
      "answers": {
        "Jamie": "I think the best analogy is that I don't ever experience anger related to ideas, but you do still experience frustration, which is a strong energetic demand from your brain to try to communicate an important idea you don't think another person is understanding. In the sense that if you are angry it is because you think another person is saying/doing something harmful, whereas if you are frustrated there is no emotion, but a forceful effort of communication to express the other person is not understanding you. Being angry feels like anger obviously, but being frustrated exclusively is just heightened energy towards a particular focus, like a dog who wants to get out of the car so it can run around.",
        "Capy": "depends lol\n\nthought process could be like: \"the 100 previous times where i gave a calm response didnt work, maybe anger is warranted\"\n\nto be fair it doesnt look like he is angry at anyone specifically, just \"people who ask that all the time\", and he basically goes back to calm right when hes done, so just looks like genuine frustration or something, not a grudge"

        "Jamie": "My understanding, and to whatever extent experience, is that in a strange and very unintuitive way everything feeds into now. The point of the phrase and what it represents conceptually is there is nothing else to feed into now. Ten years ago it was experienced by you as \"Now\". Right now you are experiencing \"Now\". In ten years you will experience that moment in time as \"Now\". You cannot experience \"everything feeds into now\" there is no other thing than now. The one and only thing in existence to you is present experience.",
        "Capy": "yeah, thoughts appear in our experience similar to a stage with many props and actors. everything has to occur together on the same singular stage, which is now. if its not happening together, it is absent, and so it isnt there at all.\n\nwhenever you're thinking, you can imagine it as looking at a whiteboard in the present moment that is describing things. the world or reality or \"now\" gets immersed in its own appearance of divisions, but it is all appearing on the \"same stage\" of now. like a whiteboard which says \"past and future\" requires both words \"past\" and \"future\" to appear together on the same singular whiteboard."
